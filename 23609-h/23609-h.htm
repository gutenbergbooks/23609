<h2>Knowledge is Safety.</h2>

  <p>1. The old maxim, that "Knowledge is power," is a true one, but there
  is still a greater truth: "<span class="sc">Knowledge is Safety</span>."
  Safety amid physical ills that beset mankind, and safety amid the moral
  pitfalls that surround so many young people, is the great crying demand
  of the age. <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>[4]</span></p>

  <p>2. <b>Criticism.</b>&mdash;While the aim of this work, though novel
  and to some extent is daring, it is chaste, practical and to the point,
  and will be a boon and a blessing to thousands who consult its pages. The
  world is full of ignorance, and the ignorant will always criticise,
  because they live to suffer ills, for they know no better. New light is
  fast falling upon the dark corners, and the eyes of many are being
  opened.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Researches of Science.</b>&mdash;The researches of science in
  the past few years have thrown light on many facts relating to the
  physiology of man and woman, and the diseases to which they are subject,
  and consequently many reformations have taken place in the treatment and
  prevention of diseases peculiar to the sexes.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Lock and Key.</b>&mdash;Any information bearing upon the
  diseases of mankind should not be kept under lock and key. The physician
  is frequently called upon to speak in plain language to his patients upon
  some private and startling disease contracted on account of ignorance.
  The better plan, however, is to so educate and enlighten old and young
  upon the important subjects of health, so that the necessity to call a
  physician may occur less frequently.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Progression.</b>&mdash;A large, respectable, though diminishing
  class in every community, maintain that nothing that relates exclusively
  to either sex should become the subject of popular medical instruction.
  But such an opinion is radically wrong; ignorance is no more the mother
  of purity than it is of religion. Enlightenment can never work injustice
  to him who investigates.</p>

  <p>6. <b>An Example.</b>&mdash;The men and women who study and practice
  medicine are not the worse, but the better for such knowledge; so it
  would be to the community in general if all would be properly instructed
  on the laws of health which relate to the sexes.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Crime and Degradation.</b>&mdash;Had every person a sound
  understanding on the relation of the sexes, one of the most fertile
  sources of crime and degradation would be removed. Physicians know too
  well what sad consequences are constantly occurring from a lack of proper
  knowledge on these important subjects.</p>

  <p>8. <b>A Consistent Consideration.</b>&mdash;Let the reader of this
  work study its pages carefully and be able to give safe counsel and
  advice to others, and remember that purity of purpose and purity of
  character are the brightest jewels in the crown of immortality.</p>

<h2>The Beginning of Life.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs006.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/006.jpg"
      alt="Beginning Right." title="Beginning Right." /></a>
    Beginning Right.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>The Beginning.</b>&mdash;There is a charm in opening manhood
  which has commended itself to the imagination in every age. The undefined
  hopes and promises of the future&mdash;the dawning strength of
  intellect&mdash;the vigorous flow of passion&mdash;the very exchange of
  home ties and protected joys for free and manly pleasures, give to this
  period an interest and excitement unfelt, perhaps, at any other.</p>

<p><!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>[6]</span></p>

  <p>2. <b>The Growth of Independence.</b>&mdash;Hitherto life has been to
  boys, as to girls, a dependent existence&mdash;a sucker from the parent
  growth&mdash;a home discipline of authority and guidance and communicated
  impulse. But henceforth it is a transplanted growth of its own&mdash;a
  new and free power of activity in which the mainspring is no longer
  authority or law from without, but principle or opinion within. The shoot
  which has been nourished under the shelter of the parent stem, and bent
  according to its inclination, is transferred to the open world, where of
  its own impulse and character it must take root, and grow into strength,
  or sink into weakness and vice.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Home Ties.</b>&mdash;The thought of home must excite a pang even
  in the first moments of freedom. Its glad shelter&mdash;its kindly
  guidance&mdash;its very restraints, how dear and tender must they seem in
  parting! How brightly must they shine in the retrospect as the youth
  turns from them to the hardened and unfamiliar face of the world! With
  what a sweet, sadly-cheering pathos they must linger in the memory! And
  then what chance and hazard is there in his newly-gotten freedom! What
  instincts of warning in its very novelty and dim inexperience! What
  possibilities of failure as well as of success in the unknown future as
  it stretches before him!</p>

  <p>4. <b>Vice or Virtue.</b>&mdash;Certainly there is a grave importance
  as well as a pleasant charm in the beginning of life. There is awe as
  well as excitement in it when rightly viewed. The possibilities that lie
  in it of noble or ignoble work&mdash;of happy self-sacrifice or ruinous
  self-indulgence&mdash;the capacities in the right use of which it may
  rise to heights of beautiful virtue, in the abuse of which it may sink to
  the depths of debasing vice&mdash;make the crisis one of fear as well as
  of hope, of sadness as well as of joy.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Success or Failure.</b>&mdash;It is wistful as well as pleasing
  to think of the young passing year by year into the world, and engaging
  with its duties, its interests, and temptations. Of the throng that
  struggle at the gates of entrance, how many may reach their anticipated
  goal? Carry the mind forward a few years, and some have climbed the hills
  of difficulty and gained the eminence on which they wished to
  stand&mdash;some, although they may not have done this, have kept their
  truth unhurt, their integrity unspoiled; but others have turned back, or
  have perished by the way, or fallen in weakness of will, no more to rise
  again; victims <span class="correction" title="text reads `or'">of</span>
  their own sin.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Warning.</b>&mdash;As we place ourselves with the young at the
  opening gates of life, and think of the end from the <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>[7]</span>beginning, it is a deep
  concern more than anything else that fills us. Words of earnest argument
  and warning counsel rather than of congratulation rise to our lips.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Mistakes Are Often Fatal.</b>&mdash;Begin well, and the habit of
  doing well will become quite as easy as the habit of doing badly. "Well
  begun is half ended," says the proverb; "and a good beginning is half the
  battle." Many promising young men have irretrievably injured themselves
  by a first false step at the commencement of life; while others, of much
  less promising talents, have succeeded simply by beginning well, and
  going onward. The good, practical beginning is, to a certain extent, a
  pledge, a promise, and an assurance of the ultimate prosperous issue.
  There is many a poor creature, now crawling through life, miserable
  himself and the cause of sorrow to others, who might have lifted up his
  head and prospered, if, instead of merely satisfying himself with
  resolutions of well-doing, he had actually gone to work and made a good,
  practical beginning.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Begin at the Right Place.</b>&mdash;Too many are, however,
  impatient of results. They are not satisfied to begin where their fathers
  did, but where they left off. They think to enjoy the fruits of industry
  without working for them. They cannot wait for the results of labor and
  application, but forestall them by too early indulgence.</p>

    SOLID COMFORT AND GOOD HEALTH.
  </div>
<h2>Health a Duty.</h2>

  <p>Perhaps nothing will so much hasten the time when body and mind will
  both be adequately cared for, as a diffusion of the belief that the
  preservation of health is a duty. Few seem conscious that there is such a
  thing as physical morality.</p>

  <p>Men's habitual words and acts imply that they are at liberty to treat
  their bodies as they please. Disorder entailed by disobedience to
  nature's dictates they regard as grievances, not as the effects of a
  conduct more or less flagitious. Though the evil consequences inflicted
  on their descendents and on future generations are often as great as
  those caused by crime, they do not think themselves in any degree
  criminal.</p>

  <p>It is true that in the case of drunkenness the viciousness of a bodily
  transgression is recognized; but none appear to infer that if this bodily
  transgression is vicious, so, too, is <!-- Page 8 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>[8]</span>every bodily transgression.
  The fact is, all breaches of the law of health are physical sins.</p>

  <p>When this is generally seen, then, and perhaps not till then, will the
  physical training of the young receive all the attention it deserves.</p>

  <p>Purity of life and thought should be taught in the home. It is the
  only safeguard of the young. Let parents wake up on this important
  subject.</p>

<hr class="full" >

<h2>Value of Reputation.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Who Shall Estimate the Cost.</b>&mdash;Who shall estimate the
  cost of a priceless reputation&mdash;that impress which gives this human
  dross its currency&mdash;without which we stand despised, debased,
  depreciated? Who shall repair it injured? Who can redeem it lost? Oh,
  well and truly does the great philosopher of poetry esteem the world's
  wealth as "trash" in the comparison. Without it gold has no value; birth,
  no distinction; station, no dignity; beauty, no charm; age, no reverence;
  without it every treasure impoverishes, every grace deforms, every
  dignity degrades, and all the arts, the decorations and accomplishments
  of life stand, like the beacon-blaze upon a rock, warning the world that
  its approach is dangerous; that its contact is death.</p>

  <p>2. <b>The Wretch Without It.</b>&mdash;The wretch without it is under
  eternal quarantine; no friend to greet; no home to harbor him, the voyage
  of his life becomes a joyless peril; and in the midst of all ambition can
  achieve, or avarice amass, or rapacity plunder, he tosses on the surge, a
  buoyant pestilence. But let me not degrade into selfishness of individual
  safety or individual exposure this individual principle; it testifies a
  higher, a more ennobling origin.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Its Divinity.</b>&mdash;Oh, Divine, oh, delightful legacy of a
  spotless reputation: Rich is the inheritance it leaves; pious the example
  it testifies; pure, precious and imperishable, the hope which it
  inspires; can there be conceived a more atrocious injury than to filch
  from its possessor this inestimable benefit to rob society of its charm,
  and solitude of its solace; not only to out-law life, but attain death,
  converting the very grave, the refuge of the sufferer, into the gate of
  infamy and of shame.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Lost Character.</b>&mdash;We can conceive few crimes beyond it.
  He who plunders my property takes from me that which can be repaired by
  time; but what period can repair a ruined reputation? He who maims my
  person effects that which medicine may remedy; but what herb has
  sovereignty over the wounds of slander? He who ridicules my poverty or
  reproaches my profession, upbraids me with that which industry may
  retrieve, and integrity may purify; but what riches shall redeem the
  bankrupt fame? What power shall blanch the sullied show of character?
  There can be no injury more deadly. There can be no crime more cruel. It

  <p>1. <b>By What Men Are Known.</b>&mdash;An author is known by his
  writings, a mother by her daughter, a fool by his words, and all men by
  their companions.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Formation of a Good Character.</b>&mdash;Intercourse with
  persons of decided virtue and excellence is of great importance in the
  formation of a good character. The force of example is powerful; we are
  creatures of imitation, and, by a necessary influence, our tempers and
  habits are very much formed on the model of those with whom we familiarly
  associate. Better be alone than in bad company. Evil communications
  corrupt good manners. Ill qualities are catching as well as diseases; and
  the mind is at least as much, if not a great deal more, liable to
  infection, than the body. Go with mean people, and you think life is
  mean.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Good Example.</b>&mdash;How natural is it for a child to look up
  to those around him for an example of imitation, and how readily does he
  copy all that he sees done, good or bad. The importance of a good example
  on which the young may exercise this powerful and active element of their
  nature, is a matter of the utmost moment.</p>

  <p>4. <b>A True Maxim.</b>&mdash;It is a trite, but true maxim, that "a
  man is known by the company he keeps." He naturally assimilates by the
  force of imitation, to the habits and manners of those by whom he is
  surrounded. We know persons who walk much with the lame, who have learned
  to walk with a hitch or limp like their lame friends. Vice stalks in the
  streets unabashed, and children copy it.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Live with the Culpable.</b>&mdash;Live with the culpable, and
  you will be very likely to die with the criminal. Bad company is like a
  nail driven into a post, which after the first or second blow, may be
  drawn out with little difficulty; but being once driven in up to the
  head, the pinchers cannot take hold to draw it out, which can only be
  done by the destruction of the wood. You may be ever so pure, you cannot
  associate with bad companions without falling into bad odor.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Society of the Vulgar.</b>&mdash;Do you love the society of the
  vulgar? Then you are already debased in your sentiments. Do you seek to
  be with the profane? In your heart you are like them. Are jesters and
  buffoons your choice friends? <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>[12]</span>He who loves to laugh at folly, is himself a
  fool. Do you love and seek the society of the wise and good? Is this your
  habit? Had you rather take the lowest seat among these than the highest
  seat among others? Then you have already learned to be good. You may not
  make very much progress, but even a good beginning is not to be
  despised.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Sinks of Pollution.</b>&mdash;Strive for mental excellence, and
  strict integrity, and you never will be found in the sinks of pollution,
  and on the benches of retailers and gamblers. Once habituate yourself to
  a virtuous course, once secure a love of good society, and no punishment
  would be greater than by accident to be obliged for half a day to
  associate with the low and vulgar. Try to frequent the company of your
  betters.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Procure no Friend in Haste.</b>&mdash;Nor, if once secured, in
  haste abandon them. Be slow in choosing an associate, and slower to
  change him; slight no man for poverty, nor esteem any one for his wealth.
  Good friends should not be easily forgotten, nor used as suits of
  apparel, which, when we have worn them threadbare, we cast them off, and
  call for new. When once you profess yourself a friend, endeavor to be
  always such. He can never have any true friends that will be often
  changing them.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Have the Courage to Cut the Most Agreeable
  Acquaintance.</b>&mdash;Do this when you are convinced that he lacks
  principle; a friend should bear with a friend's infirmities, but not with
  his vices. He that does a base thing in zeal for his friend, burns the
  golden thread that ties their hearts together.</p>

<h2>Self-Control.</h2>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Honor and profit do not always lie in the same sack."&mdash;<span
  class="sc">George Herbert</span>.</p>

  <p>"The government of one's self is the only true freedom for the
  individual."&mdash;<span class="sc">Frederick Perthes</span>.</p>

  <p>"It is length of patience, and endurance, and forebearance, that so
  much of what is called good in mankind and womankind is
  shown."&mdash;<span class="sc">Arthur Helps</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>1. <b>Essence of Character.</b>&mdash;Self-control is only courage
  under another form. It may also be regarded as the primary essence of
  character. It is in virtue of this quality that Shakespeare defines man
  as a being "looking before and after." It forms the chief distinction
  between man and the mere animal; and, indeed, there can be no true
  manhood without it.</p>

      alt="The Result of Bad Company." title="The Result of Bad Company." /></a>
    THE RESULT OF BAD COMPANY.
  </div>
  <p>2. <b>Root of all the Virtues.</b>&mdash;Self-control is at the root
  <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>[14]</span>of
  all the virtues. Let a man give the reins to his impulses and passions,
  and from that moment he yields up his moral freedom. He is carried along
  the current of life, and becomes the slave of his strongest desire for
  the time being.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Resist Instinctive Impulse.</b>&mdash;To be morally
  free&mdash;to be more than an animal&mdash;man must be able to resist
  instinctive impulse, and this can only be done by exercise of
  self-control. Thus it is this power which constitutes the real
  distinction between a physical and a moral life, and that forms the
  primary basis of individual character.</p>

  <p>4. <b>A Strong Man Ruleth His Own Spirit.</b>&mdash;In the Bible
  praise is given, not to a strong man who "taketh a city," but to the
  stronger man who "ruleth his own spirit." This stronger man is he who, by
  discipline, exercises a constant control over his thoughts, his speech,
  and his acts. Nine-tenths of the vicious desires that degrade society,
  and which, when indulged, swell into the crimes that disgrace it, would
  shrink into insignificance before the advance of valiant self-discipline,
  self-respect, and self-control. By the watchful exercise of these
  virtues, purity of heart and mind become habitual, and the character is
  built up in chastity, virtue, and temperance.</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Best Support.</b>&mdash;The best support of character will
  always be found in habit, which, according as the will is directed
  rightly or wrongly, as the case may be, will prove either a benignant
  ruler, or a cruel despot. We may be its willing subject on the one hand,
  or its servile slave on the other. It may help us on the road to good, or
  it may hurry us on the road to ruin.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Ideal Man.</b>&mdash;"In the supremacy of self-control,"
  says Herbert Spencer, "consists one of the perfections of the ideal man.
  Not to be impulsive, not to be spurred hither and thither by each desire
  that in turn comes uppermost, but to be self-restrained, self-balanced,
  governed by the joint decision of the feelings in council assembled,
  before whom every action shall have been fully debated, and calmly
  determined&mdash;that it is which education, moral education at least,
  strives to produce."</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Best Regulated Home.</b>&mdash;The best regulated home is
  always that in which the discipline is the most perfect, and yet where it
  is the least felt. Moral discipline acts with the force of a law of
  nature. Those subject to it yield themselves to it unconsciously; and
  though it shapes and forms the whole character, until the life becomes
  crystallized in habit, the influence thus exercised is for the most part
  unseen, and almost unfelt. <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>[15]</span></p>

  <p>8. <b>Practice Self-denial.</b>&mdash;If a man would get through life
  honorably and peaceably, he must necessarily learn to practice
  self-denial in small things as well as in great. Men have to bear as well
  as to forbear. The temper has to be held in subjection to the judgment;
  and the little demons of ill-humor, petulance, and sarcasm, kept
  resolutely at a distance. If once they find an entrance to the mind, they
  are apt to return, and to establish for themselves a permanent occupation
  there.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Power of Words.</b>&mdash;It is <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `neccessary'">necessary</span> to one's personal
  happiness, to exercise control over one's words as well as acts: for
  there are words that strike even harder than blows; and men may "speak
  daggers," though they use none. The stinging repartee that rises to the
  lips, and which, if uttered, might cover an adversary with confusion, how
  difficult it is to resist saying it! "Heaven, keep us," says Miss Bremer,
  in her 'Home', "from the destroying power of words! There are words that
  sever hearts more than sharp swords do; there are words the point of
  which sting the heart through the course of a whole life."</p>

  <p>10. <b>Character Exhibits Itself.</b>&mdash;Character exhibits itself
  in self-control of speech as much as in anything else. The wise and
  forbearant man will restrain his desire to say a smart or severe thing at
  the expense of another's feeling; while the fool blurts out what he
  thinks, and will sacrifice his friend rather than his joke. "The mouth of
  a wise man," said Solomon, "is in his heart: the heart of a fool is in
  his mouth."</p>

  <p>11. <b>Burns.</b>&mdash;No one knew the value of self-control better
  than the poet Burns, and no one could teach it more eloquently to others,
  but when it came to practice, Burns was as weak as the weakest. He could
  not deny himself the pleasure of uttering a harsh and clever sarcasm at
  another's expense. One of his biographers observed of him, that it was no
  extravagant arithmetic to say that for every ten jokes he made himself a
  hundred enemies. But this was not all. Poor Burns exercised no control
  over his appetites, but freely gave them the rein:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thus thoughtless follies laid him low,</p>
      <p>And stained his name."</p>
    </div>

      alt="Lost Self-control." title="Lost Self-control." /></a>
    LOST SELF-CONTROL.
  </div>
  <p>12. <b>Sow Pollution.</b>&mdash;Nor had he the self-denial to resist
  giving publicity to compositions originally intended for the delight of
  the tap-room, but which continued secretly to sow pollution broadcast in
  the minds of youth. Indeed, notwithstanding the many exquisite poems of
  this writer, it is not saying too much that his immoral writings have
  done far more harm than his purer writings have done good; and <!-- Page
  16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>[16]</span>it would be
  better that all his writings should be destroyed and forgotten, provided
  his indecent songs could be destroyed with them.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Moral Principle.</b>&mdash;Many of our young men lack moral
  principle. They cannot look upon a beautiful girl with a pure heart and
  pure thoughts. They have not manifested or practiced that self-control
  which develops true manhood, and brings into subordination evil thoughts,
  evil passions, and evil practices. Men who have no self-control will find
  life a failure, both in a social and in a business sense. The world
  despises an insignificant person who lacks backbone and character. Stand
  upon your manhood and womanhood; honor your convictions, and dare to do
  right.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Strong Drink.</b>&mdash;There is the habit of strong drink. It
  is only the lack of self-control that brings men into the depths of
  degradation; on account of the cup, the habit of taking drink
  occasionally in its milder forms&mdash;of playing with a small appetite
  that only needs sufficient playing with to make you a demon or a dolt.
  You think you are safe; I know you are not safe, if you drink at all; and
  when you get offended with the good friends that warn you of your danger,
  you are a fool. I know that the grave swallows daily, by scores,
  drunkards, every one of whom thought he was safe while he was forming his
  appetite. But this is old talk. A young man in this age who forms the
  habit of drinking, or puts himself in danger of forming the habit, is
  usually so weak that it doesn't pay to save him.</p>

<h2>Habit.</h2>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It is almost as difficult to make a man unlearn his Errors as his
  Knowledge.&mdash;<span class="sc">Colton</span>.</p>

  <p>There are habits contracted by bad example, or bad management, before
  we have judgment to discern their approaches, or because the eye of
  Reason is laid asleep, or has not compass of view sufficient to look
  around on every quarter.&mdash;<span class="sc">Tucker</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>1. <b>Habit.</b>&mdash;Our real strength in life depends upon habits
  formed in early life. The young man who sows his wild oats and indulges
  in the social cup, is fastening chains upon himself that never can be
  broken. The innocent youth by solitary practice of self-abuse will fasten
  upon himself a habit which will wreck his physical constitution and bring
  suffering and misery and ruin. Young man and young woman, beware of bad
  habits formed in early life.</p>

  <p>2. <b>A Bundle of Habits.</b>&mdash;Man, it has been said, is a bundle
  of habits; and habit is second nature. Metastasio entertained so strong
  an opinion as to the power of repetition in act and thought, that he
  said, "All is habit in mankind, even virtue itself." Evil habits must be
  conquered, or they will conquer us and destroy our peace and
  happiness.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Vicious Habits.</b>&mdash;Vicious habits, when opposed, offer
  the most vigorous resistence on the first attack. At each successive
  encounter this resistence grows fainter and fainter, until finally it
  ceases altogether and the victory is achieved. Habit is man's best friend
  and worst enemy; it can exalt him to the highest pinnacle of virtue,
  honor and happiness, or sink him to the lowest depths of vice, shame and
  misery.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Honesty, or Knavery.</b>&mdash;We may form habits of honesty, or
  knavery; truth, or falsehood; of industry, or idleness; frugality, or
  extravagance; of patience, or impatience; self-denial, or
  self-indulgence; of kindness, cruelty, politeness, rudeness, prudence,
  perseverance, circumspection. In short, there is not a virtue, nor a
  vice; not an act of body, nor of mind, to which we may not be chained
  down by this despotic power.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Begin Well.</b>&mdash;It is a great point for young men to begin
  well; for it is the beginning of life that that system of conduct is
  adopted which soon assumes the force of habit. Begin well, and the habit
  of doing well will become quite easy, as easy as the habit of doing
  badly. Pitch upon that course of life which is the most excellent, and
  habit will render it the most delightful.</p>

<hr class="full" >

<p><!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<h2>A Good Name.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>The Longing for a Good Name.</b>&mdash;The longing for a good
  name is one of those laws of nature that were passed for the soul and
  written down within to urge toward a life of action, and away from small
  or wicked action. So large is this passion that it is set forth in poetic
  thought, as having a temple grand as that of Jupiter or Minerva, and up
  whose marble steps all noble minds struggle&mdash;the temple of Fame.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Civilization.</b>&mdash;Civilization is the ocean of which the
  millions of individuals are the rivers and torrents. These rivers and
  torrents swell with those rains of money and home and fame and happiness,
  and then fall and run almost dry, but the ocean of civilization has
  gathered up all these waters, and holds them in sparkling beauty for all
  subsequent use. Civilization is a fertile delta made by the drifting
  souls of men.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Fame.</b>&mdash;The word "fame" never signifies simply
  notoriety. The meaning of the direct term may be seen from its negation
  or opposite, for only the meanest of men are called infamous. They are
  utterly without fame, utterly nameless; but if fame implied only
  notoriety then infamous would possess no marked significance. Fame is an
  undertaker that pays but little attention to the living, but who bedizens
  the dead, furnishes out their funerals and follows them to the grave.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Life-Motive.</b>&mdash;So in studying that life-motive which is
  called a "good name," we must ask the large human race to tell us the
  high merit of this spiritual longing. We must read the words of the sage,
  who said long centuries ago that "a good name was rather chosen than
  great riches." Other sages have said as much. Solon said that "He that
  will sell his good name will sell the State." Socrates said, "Fame is the
  perfume of heroic deeds." Our Shakspeare said, "He lives in fame who died
  in virtue's cause."</p>

  <p>5. <b>Influences of Our Age.</b>&mdash;Our age is deeply influenced by
  the motives called property and home and pleasure, but it is a question
  whether the generation in action to-day and the generation on the
  threshold of this intense life are conscious fully of the worth of an
  honorable name.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Beauty of Character.</b>&mdash;We do not know whether with us
  all a good name is less sweet than it was with our fathers, but this is
  painfully evident, that our times do not sufficiently behold the beauty
  of character&mdash;their sense does not <!-- Page 19 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[19]</span>detect quickly enough or
  love deeply enough this aroma of heroic deeds.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Selling Out Their Reputation.</b>&mdash;It is amazing what
  multitudes there are who are willing to sell out their reputation, and
  amazing at what a low price they will make the painful exchange. Some
  king remarked that he would not tell a lie for any reward less than an
  empire. It is not uncommon in our world for a man to sell out all his
  honor and hopes for a score or a half score of dollars.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Prisons Overflowing.</b>&mdash;Our prisons are all full to
  overflowing of those who took no thought of honor. They have not waited
  for an empire to be offered them before they would violate the sacred
  rights of man, but many of them have even murdered for a cause that would
  not have justified even an exchange of words.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Integrity the Pride of the Government.</b>&mdash;If integrity
  were made the pride of the government, the love of it would soon spring
  up among the people. If all fraudulent men should go straight to jail,
  pitilessly, and if all the most rigid characters were sought out for all
  political and commercial offices, there would soon come a popular honesty
  just as there has come a love of reading or of art. It is with character
  as with any new article&mdash;the difficulty lies in its first
  introduction.</p>

  <p>10. <b>A New Virtue.</b>&mdash;May a new virtue come into favor, all
  our high rewards, those from the ballot-box, those from employers, the
  rewards of society, the rewards of the press, should be offered only to
  the worthy. A few years of rewarding the worthy would result in a
  wonderful zeal in the young to build up, not physical property, but
  mental and spiritual worth.</p>

      alt="An Arab Princess." title="An Arab Princess." /></a>
    AN ARAB PRINCESS.
  </div>
  <p>11. <b>Blessing the Family Group.</b>&mdash;No young man or young
  woman can by industry and care reach an eminence in study or art or
  character, without blessing the entire family group. We have all seen
  that the father and mother feel that all life's care and labor were at
  last perfectly rewarded in the success of their child. But had the child
  been reckless or indolent, all this domestic joy&mdash;the joy of a large
  group&mdash;would have been blighted forever.</p>

  <p>12. <b>An Honored Child.</b>&mdash;There have been triumphs at old
  Rome, where victors marched along with many a chariot, many an elephant,
  and many spoils of the East; and in all times money has been lavished in
  the efforts of States to tell their pleasure in the name of some general;
  but more numerous and wide-spread and beyond expression, by chariot or
  cannon or drum, have been those triumphal <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>[20]</span>hours, when some son or
  daughter has returned to the parental hearth beautiful in the wreaths of
  some confessed excellence, bearing a good name.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Rich Criminals.</b>&mdash;We looked at the utter wretchedness
  of the men who threw away reputation, and would rather be rich criminals
  in exile than be loved friends and persons at home.</p>

  <p>14. <b>An Empty, or an Evil Name.</b>&mdash;Young and old cannot
  afford to bear the burden of an empty or an evil name. A good name is a
  motive of life. It is a reason for that great encampment we call an
  existence. While you are building the home of to-morrow, build up also
  that kind of soul that can sleep sweetly on home's pillow, and can feel
  that God is not near as an avenger of wrong, but as the Father not only
  of the verdure and the seasons, but of you. Live a pure life and bear a
  good name, and your reward will be sure and great.</p>

    A PRAYERFUL AND DEVOTED MOTHER.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Her Influence.</b>&mdash;It is true to nature, although it be
  expressed in a figurative form, that a mother is both the morning and the
  evening star of life. The light of her eye is always the first to rise,
  and often the last to set upon man's day of trial. She wields a power
  more decisive far than syllogisms in argument or courts of last appeal in
  authority.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Her Love.</b>&mdash;Mother! ecstatic sound so twined round our
  hearts that they must cease to throb ere we forget it; 'tis our first
  love; 'tis part of religion. Nature has set the mother upon such a
  pinnacle that our infant eyes and arms are first uplifted to it; we cling
  to it in manhood; we almost worship it in old age.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Her Tenderness.</b>&mdash;Alas! how little do we appreciate a
  mother's tenderness while living. How heedless are we in youth of all her
  anxieties and kindness! But when she is dead and gone, when the cares and
  coldness of the world come withering to our hearts, when we experience
  for ourselves how hard it is to find true sympathy, how few to love us,
  how few will befriend us in misfortune, then it is that we think of the
  mother we have lost.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Her Controlling Power.</b>&mdash;The mother can take man's whole
  nature under her control. She becomes what she has been called, "The
  Divinity of Infancy." Her smile is its sunshine, her word its mildest
  law, until sin and the world have steeled the heart.</p>

<p><!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>[22]</span></p>

  <p>5. <b>The Last Tie.</b>&mdash;The young man who has forsaken the
  advice and influence of his mother has broken the last cable and severed
  the last tie that binds him to an honorable and upright life. He has
  forsaken his best friend, and every hope for his future welfare may be
  abandoned, for he is lost forever. If he is faithless to mother, he will
  have but little respect for wife and children.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Home Ties.</b>&mdash;The young man or young woman who love their
  home and love their mother can be safely trusted under almost any and all
  circumstances, and their life will not be a blank, for they seek what is
  good. Their hearts will be ennobled, and God will bless them.</p>

  cease only with life.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Home Makes the Man.</b>&mdash;It is a common saying, "Manners
  make the man;" and there is a second, that "Mind makes the man;" but
  truer than either is a third, that "Home makes the man." For the
  home-training includes not only manners and mind, but character. It is
  mainly in the home that the heart is opened, the habits are formed, the
  intellect is awakened, and character moulded for good or for evil.</p>

<p><!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[24]</span></p>

  <p>3. <b>Govern Society.</b>&mdash;From that source, be it pure or
  impure, issue the principles and maxims that govern society. Law itself
  is but the reflex of homes. The tiniest bits of opinion sown in the minds
  of children in private life afterwards issue forth to the world, and
  become its public opinion; for nations are gathered out of nurseries, and
  they who hold the leading-strings of children may even exercise a greater
  power than those who wield the reins of government.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Child Is Father of the Man.</b>&mdash;The child's character
  is the nucleus of the man's; all after-education is but superposition;
  the form of the crystal remains the same. Thus the saying of the poet
  holds true in a large degree, "The child is father of the man;" or as
  Milton puts it, "The childhood shows the man, as morning shows the day."
  Those impulses to conduct which last the longest and are rooted the
  deepest, always have their origin near our birth. It is then that the
  germs of virtues or vices, of feelings or sentiments, are first implanted
  which determine the character of life.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Nurseries.</b>&mdash;Thus homes, which are nurseries of children
  who grow up into men and women, will be good or bad according to the
  power that governs them. Where the spirit of love and duty pervades the
  home, where head and heart bear rule wisely there, where the daily life
  is honest and virtuous, where the government is sensible, kind, and
  loving, then may we expect from such a home an issue of healthy, useful,
  and happy beings, capable as they gain the requisite strength, of
  following the footsteps of their parents, of walking uprightly, governing
  themselves wisely, and contributing to the welfare of those about
  them.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Ignorance, Coarseness, and Selfishness.</b>&mdash;On the other
  hand, if surrounded by ignorance, coarseness, and selfishness, they will
  unconsciously assume the same character, and grow up to adult years rude,
  uncultivated, and all the more dangerous to society if placed amidst the
  manifold temptations of what is called civilized life. "Give your child
  to be educated by a slave," said an ancient Greek, "and, instead of one
  slave, you will then have two."</p>

  <p>7. <b>Maternal Love.</b>&mdash;Maternal love is the visible providence
  of our race. Its influence is constant and universal. It begins with the
  education of the human being at the outstart of life, and is prolonged by
  virtue of the powerful influence which every good mother exercises over
  her children through life. When launched into the world, each to take
  part in its labors, anxieties, and trials, they still turn <!-- Page 25
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>[25]</span>to their mother
  for consolation, if not for counsel, in their time of trouble and
  difficulty. The pure and good thoughts she has implanted in their minds
  when children continue to grow up into good acts long after she is dead;
  and when there is nothing but a memory of her left, her children rise up
  and call her blessed.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Woman, above All Other Educators</b>, educates humanly. Man is
  the brain, but woman is the heart of humanity; he its judgment, she its
  feeling; he its strength, she its grace, ornament, and solace. Even the
  understanding of the best woman seems to work mainly through her
  affections. And thus, though man may direct the intellect, woman
  cultivates the feelings, which mainly determine the character. While he
  fills the memory, she occupies the heart. She makes us love what he can
  make us only believe, and it is chiefly through her that we are enabled
  to arrive at virtue.</p>

  <p>9. <b>The Poorest Dwelling</b>, presided over by a virtuous, thrifty,
  cheerful, and cleanly woman, may thus be the abode of comfort, virtue,
  and happiness; it may be the scene of every ennobling relation in family
  life; it may be endeared to man by many delightful associations;
  furnishing a sanctuary for the heart, a refuge from the storms of life, a
  sweet resting-place after labor, a consolation in misfortune, a pride in
  prosperity, and a joy at all times.</p>

  <p>10. <b>The Good Home Is Thus the Best of Schools</b>, not only in
  youth but in age. There young and old best learn cheerfulness, patience,
  self-control, and the spirit of service and of duty. The home is the true
  school of courtesy, of which woman is always the best practical
  instructor. "Without woman," says the Provencal proverb, "men were but
  ill-licked cubs." Philanthropy radiates from the home as from a centre.
  "To love the little platoon we belong to in society," said Burke, "is the
  germ of all public affections." The wisest and best have not been ashamed
  to own it to be their greatest joy and happiness to sit "behind the heads
  of children" in the inviolable circle of home.</p>

    MEDITATION.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>To Be a Woman</b>, in the truest and highest sense of the word,
  is to be the best thing beneath the skies. To be a woman is something
  more than to live eighteen or twenty years; something more than to grow
  to the physical stature of women; something more than to wear flounces,
  exhibit dry goods, sport jewelry, catch the gaze of lewd-eyed men; <!--
  Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>[27]</span>something more than to be a belle, a wife,
  or a mother. Put all these qualifications together and they do but little
  toward making a true woman.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Beauty and Style</b> are not the surest passports to
  womanhood&mdash;some of the noblest specimens of womanhood that the world
  has ever seen have presented the plainest and most unprepossessing
  appearance. A woman's worth is to be estimated by the real goodness of
  her heart, the greatness of her soul, and the purity and sweetness of her
  character; and a woman with a kindly disposition and well-balanced temper
  is both lovely and attractive, be her face ever so plain, and her figure
  ever so homely; she makes the best of wives and the truest of
  mothers.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Beauty Is a Dangerous Gift.</b>&mdash;It is even so. Like
  wealth, it has ruined its thousands. Thousands of the most beautiful
  women are destitute of common sense and common humanity. No gift from
  heaven is so general and so widely abused by woman as the gift of beauty.
  In about nine cases in ten it makes her silly, senseless, thoughtless,
  giddy, vain, proud, frivolous, selfish, low and mean. I think I have seen
  more girls spoiled by beauty than by any other one thing. "She is
  beautiful, and she knows it," is as much as to say that she is spoiled. A
  beautiful girl is very likely to believe she was made to be looked at;
  and so she sets herself up for a show at every window, in every door, on
  every corner of the street, in every company at which opportunity offers
  for an exhibition of herself.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Beware of Beautiful Women.</b>&mdash;These facts have long since
  taught sensible men to beware of beautiful women&mdash;to sound them
  carefully before they give them their confidence. Beauty is
  shallow&mdash;only skin deep; fleeting&mdash;only for a few years' reign;
  dangerous&mdash;tempting to vanity and lightness of mind;
  deceitful&mdash;dazzling often to bewilder; weak&mdash;reigning only to
  ruin; gross&mdash;leading often to sensual pleasure. And yet we say it
  need not be so. Beauty is lovely and ought to be innocently possessed. It
  has charms which ought to be used for good purposes. It is a delightful
  gift, which ought to be received with gratitude and worn with grace and
  meekness. It should always minister to inward beauty. Every woman of
  beautiful form and features should cultivate a beautiful mind and
  heart.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Rival the Boys.</b>&mdash;We want the girls to rival the boys in
  all that is good, and refined, and ennobling. We want them to rival the
  boys, as they well can, in learning, in understanding, in virtues; in all
  noble qualities of mind and heart, but not in any of those things that
  have caused them, justly or unjustly, to be described as savages. We want
  <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[28]</span>the
  girls to be gentle&mdash;not weak, but gentle, and kind and affectionate.
  We want to be sure, that wherever a girl is, there should be a sweet,
  subduing and harmonizing influence of purity, and truth, and love,
  pervading and hallowing, from center to circumference, the entire circle
  in which she moves. If the boys are savages, we want her to be their
  civilizer. We want her to tame them, to subdue their ferocity, to soften
  their manners, and to teach them all needful lessons of order, sobriety,
  and meekness, and patience, and goodness.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Kindness.</b>&mdash;Kindness is the ornament of man&mdash;it is
  the chief glory of woman&mdash;it is, indeed, woman's true
  prerogative&mdash;her sceptre and her crown. It is the sword with which
  she conquers, and the charm with which she captivates.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Admired and Beloved.</b>&mdash;Young lady, would you be admired
  and beloved? Would you be an ornament to your sex, and a blessing to your
  race? Cultivate this heavenly virtue. Wealth may surround you with its
  blandishments, and beauty, and learning, or talents, may give you
  admirers, but love and kindness alone can captivate the heart. Whether
  you live in a cottage or a palace, these graces can surround you with
  perpetual sunshine, making you, and all around you, happy.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Inward Grace.</b>&mdash;Seek ye then, fair daughters, the
  possession of that inward grace, whose essence shall permeate and
  vitalize the affections, adorn the countenance, make mellifluous the
  voice, and impart a hallowed beauty even to your motions. Not merely that
  you may be loved, would I urge this, but that you may, in truth, be
  lovely&mdash;that loveliness which fades not with time, nor is marred or
  alienated by disease, but which neither chance nor change can in any way
  despoil.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Silken Enticements of the Stranger.</b>&mdash;We urge you,
  gentle maiden, to beware of the silken enticements of the stranger, until
  your love is confirmed by protracted acquaintance. Shun the idler, though
  his coffers overflow with pelf. Avoid the irreverent&mdash;the scoffer of
  hallowed things; and him who "looks upon the wine while it is red;" him
  too, "who hath a high look and a proud heart," and who "privily
  slandereth his neighbor." Do not heed the specious prattle about "first
  love," and so place, irrevocably, the seal upon your future destiny,
  before you have sounded, in silence and secrecy, the deep fountains of
  your own heart. Wait, rather, until your own character and that of him
  who would woo you, is more fully developed. Surely, if this "first love"
  cannot endure a short probation, fortified by "the <!-- Page 29 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[29]</span>pleasures of hope," how
  can it be expected to survive years of intimacy, scenes of trial,
  distracting cares, wasting sickness, and all the homely routine of
  practical life? Yet it is these that constitute life, and the love that
  cannot abide them is false and must die.</p>

<h2>Influence of Female Character.</h2>

    ROMAN LADIES.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Moral Effect.</b>&mdash;It is in its moral effect on the mind
  and the heart of man, that the influence of woman is most powerful and
  important. In the diversity of tastes, habits, inclinations, and pursuits
  of the two sexes, is found a most beneficent provision for controlling
  the force and extravagance of human passion. The objects which most
  strongly seize and stimulate the mind of man, rarely act at the same time
  and with equal power on the mind of woman. She is naturally better,
  purer, and more chaste in thought and language.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Female Character.</b>&mdash;But the influence of female
  character on the virtue of men, is not seen merely in restraining and
  softening the violence of human passion. To her is mainly committed the
  task of pouring into the opening mind of infancy its first impressions of
  duty, and of stamping on its susceptible heart the first image of its
  God. Who will not confess the influence of a mother in forming the heart
  of a child? What man is there who can not trace the origin of many of the
  best maxims of his life to the lips of her who gave him birth? How wide,
  how lasting, how sacred is that part of a woman's influence.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Virtue of a Community.</b>&mdash;There is yet another mode, by
  which woman may exert a powerful influence on the virtue of a community.
  It rests with her in a pre-eminent degree, to give tone and elevation to
  the moral character of the age, by deciding the degree of virtue that
  shall be necessary to afford a passport to her society. If all the favor
  of woman were given only to the good, if it were known that the charms
  and attractions of beauty, and wisdom, and wit, were reserved only for
  the pure; if, in one word, something of a similar rigor were exerted to
  exclude the profligate and abandoned of society, as is shown to those who
  have fallen from virtue,&mdash;how much would be done to re-enforce the
  motives to moral purity among us, and impress on the minds of all a
  reverence for the sanctity and obligations of virtue.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Influence of Woman on the Moral Sentiments.</b>&mdash;The
  influence of woman on the moral sentiments of society is intimately
  connected with her influence on its religious character; for religion and
  a pure and elevated morality must ever stand in the relation to each
  other of effect and cause. The heart of a woman is formed for the abode
  of sacred truth; and for the reasons alike honorable to her character and
  to that of society. From the nature of humanity this must be so, or the
  race would soon degenerate, and moral contagion eat out the heart of
  society. The purity of home is the safeguard to American manhood.</p>

  <p>1. <b>Words of the Great Teacher.</b>&mdash;Mark the words of the
  Great Teacher: "If thy right hand or foot cause thee to fall, cut it off
  and cast it from thee. If thy right eye cause thee to fall, pluck it out.
  It is better for thee to enter into life maimed and halt, than having two
  eyes to be cast into hell-fire, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is
  not quenched."</p>

  <p>2. <b>A Melancholy Fact.</b>&mdash;It is a melancholy fact, in human
  experience, that the noblest gifts which men possess are constantly
  prostituted to other purposes than those for which they are designed. The
  most valuable and useful organs of the body are those which are capable
  of the greatest dishonor, abuse, and corruption. What a snare the
  wonderful organism of the eye may become, when used to read corrupt
  books, or to look upon licentious pictures, or vulgar theater scenes, or
  when used to meet the fascinating gaze of the harlot! What an instrument
  for depraving the whole man may be found in the matchless powers of the
  brain, the hand, the mouth, or the tongue! What potent instruments may
  these become in accomplishing the ruin of the whole being, for time and
  eternity! <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>[32]</span></p>

  <p>3. <b>Abstinence.</b>&mdash;Some can testify with thankfulness that
  they never knew the sins of gambling, drunkenness, fornication, or
  adultery. In all these cases abstinence has been, and continues to be,
  liberty. Restraint is the noblest freedom. No man can affirm that
  self-denial ever injured him; on the contrary, self-restraint has been
  liberty, strength and blessing. Solemnly ask young men to remember this
  when temptation and passion strive as a floodtide to move them from the
  anchorage and peace of self-restraint. Beware of the deceitful stream of
  temporary gratification, whose eddying current drifts towards license,
  shame, disease and death. Remember how quickly moral power declines, how
  rapidly the edge of the fatal maelstrom is reached, how near the vortex,
  how terrible the penalty, how fearful the sentence of everlasting
  punishment!</p>

  <p>4. <b>Frank Discussion.</b>&mdash;The time has arrived for a full and
  frank discussion of those things which affect the personal purity.
  Thousands are suffering to-day from various weaknesses, the causes of
  which they have never learned. Manly vigor is not increasing with that
  rapidity which a Christian age demands. Means of dissipation are on the
  increase. It is high time, therefore, that every lover of the race should
  call a halt, and inquire into the condition of things. Excessive modesty
  on this subject is not virtue. Timidity in presenting unpleasant but
  important truths has permitted untold damage in every age.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Man Is a Careless Being.</b>&mdash;He is very much inclined to
  sinful things. He more often does that which is wrong than that which is
  right, because it is easier, and, for the moment, perhaps, more
  satisfying to the flesh. The Creator is often blamed for man's weaknesses
  and inconsistencies. This is wrong. God did not intend that we should be
  mere machines, but free moral agents. We are privileged to choose between
  good and evil. Hence, if we perseveringly choose the latter, and make a
  miserable failure of life, we should blame only ourselves.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Pulpit.</b>&mdash;Would that every pulpit in the land might
  join hands with the medical profession and cry out with no uncertain
  sound against the mighty evils herein stigmatized! It would work a
  revolution for which coming society could never cease to be grateful.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Strive to Attain a Higher Life.</b>&mdash;Strive to attain unto
  a higher and better life. Beware of all excesses, of whatever nature, and
  guard your personal purity with sacred determination. Let every
  aspiration be upward, and be strong in every good resolution. Seek the
  light, for in light there is life, while in darkness there is decay and
  death. <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h2>How to Write All Kinds of Letters.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs035.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/035.jpg"
      alt="The Letter-Writer." title="The Letter-Writer." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>1. From the President in his cabinet to the laborer in the street;
  from the lady in her parlor to the servant in her kitchen; from the
  millionaire to the beggar; from the emigrant to the settler; from every
  country and under every combination of circumstances, letter writing in
  all its forms and varieties is most important to the advancement, welfare
  and happiness of the human family.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Education.</b>&mdash;-The art of conveying thought through the
  medium of written language is so valuable and so necessary, a thorough
  knowledge of the practice must be desirable to every one. For merely to
  write a good letter requires the exercise of much of the education and
  talent of any writer.</p>

  <p>3. <b>A Good Letter.</b>&mdash;A good letter must be correct in every
  mechanical detail, finished in style, interesting in substance, and
  intelligible in construction. Few there are who do not need write them;
  yet a letter perfect in detail is rarer than any other specimen of
  composition.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Penmanship.</b>&mdash;It is folly to suppose that the faculty
  for writing a good hand is confined to any particular persons. There is
  no one who can write at all, but what can write well, if only the
  necessary pains are practiced. Practice makes perfect. Secure a few copy
  books and write an hour each day. You will soon write a good hand. <!--
  Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>[35]</span></p>

  <p>5. <b>Write Plainly.</b>&mdash;Every word of even the most trifling
  document should be written in such clear characters that it would be
  impossible to mistake it for another word, or the writer may find himself
  in the position of the Eastern merchant who, writing to the Indies for
  five thousand mangoes, received by the next vessel five hundred monkies,
  with a promise of more in the next cargo.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Haste.</b>&mdash;Hurry is no excuse for bad writing, because any
  one of sense knows that everything hurried is liable to be ruined.
  Dispatch may be acquired, but hurry will ruin everything. If, however,
  you must write slowly to write well, then be careful not to hurry at all,
  for the few moments you will gain by rapid writing will never compensate
  you for the disgrace of sending an ill-written letter.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Neatness.</b>&mdash;Neatness is also of great importance. A fair
  white sheet with handsomely written words will be more welcome to any
  reader than a blotted, bedaubed page covered with erasures and dirt, even
  if the matter in each be of equal value and interest. Erasures, blots,
  interlineations always spoil the beauty of any letter.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Bad Spelling.</b>&mdash;When those who from faulty education, or
  forgetfulness are doubtful about the correct spelling of any word, it is
  best to keep a dictionary at hand, and refer to it upon such occasions.
  It is far better to spend a few moments in seeking for a doubtful word,
  than to dispatch an ill-spelled letter, and the search will probably
  impress the spelling upon the mind for a future occasion.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Carelessness.</b>&mdash;Incorrect spelling will expose the most
  important or interesting letter to the severest sarcasm and ridicule.
  However perfect in all other respects, no epistle that is badly spelled
  will be regarded as the work of an educated gentleman or lady.
  Carelessness will never be considered, and to be ignorant of spelling is
  to expose an imperfect education at once.</p>

  <p>10. <b>An Excellent Practice.</b>&mdash;After writing a letter, read
  it over carefully, correct all the errors and re-write it. If you desire
  to become a good letter writer, improve your penmanship, improve your
  language and grammar, re-writing once or twice every letter that you have
  occasion to write, whether on social or business subjects.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Punctuation.</b>&mdash;A good rule for punctuation is to
  punctuate where the sense requires it, after writing a letter and reading
  it over carefully you will see where the punctuation marks are required,
  you can readily determine where the sense requires it, so that your
  letter will convey the desired meaning. <!-- Page 36 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>[36]</span></p>

      alt="Pen and Ink." title="Pen and Ink." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>12. <b>Correspondence.</b>&mdash;There is no better school or better
  source for self-improvement than a pleasant correspondence between
  friends. It is not at all difficult to secure a good list of
  correspondents if desired. The young people who take advantage of such
  opportunities for self-improvement will be much more popular in the
  community and in society. Letter writing cultivates the habit of study;
  it cultivates the mind, the heart, and stimulates self-improvement in
  general.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Folding.</b>&mdash;Another bad practice with those unaccustomed
  to corresponding is to fold the sheet of writing in such a fantastic
  manner as to cause the receiver much annoyance in opening it. To the
  sender it may appear a very ingenious performance, but to the receiver it
  is only a source of vexation and annoyance, and may prevent the
  communication receiving the attention it would otherwise merit.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Simple Style.</b>&mdash;The style of letter writing should be
  simple and unaffected, not raised on stilts and indulging in pedantic
  displays which are mostly regarded as cloaks of ignorance. Repeated
  literary quotations, involved sentences, long-sounding words and scraps
  of Latin, French and other languages are, generally speaking, out of
  place, and should not be indulged in.</p>

  <p>15. <b>The Result.</b>&mdash;A well written letter has opened the way
  to prosperity for many a one, has led to many a happy marriage and
  constant friendship, and has secured many a good service in time of need;
  for it is in some measure a photograph of the writer, and may inspire
  love or hatred, regard or aversion in the reader, just as the glimpse of
  a portrait often determine us, in our estimate, of the worth of the
  person represented. Therefore, one of the roads to fortune runs through
  the ink bottle, and if we want to attain a certain end in love,
  friendship or business, we must trace out the route correctly with the
  pen in our hand.</p>

<h2>HOW TO WRITE A LOVE LETTER.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Love.</b>&mdash;There is no greater or more profound reality
  than love. Why that reality should be obscured by mere sentimentalism,
  with all its train of absurdities is incomprehensible. There is no nobler
  possession than the love of another. There is no higher gift from one
  human being to another than love. The gift and the possession are true
  sanctifiers of life, and should be worn as precious jewels without
  affectation and without bashfulness. For this reason there is nothing to
  be ashamed of in a love letter, provided it be sincere.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Forfeits.</b>&mdash;No man need consider that he forfeits
  dignity if he speaks with his whole heart: no woman need fear she
  forfeits her womanly attributes if she responds as her heart bids her
  respond. "Perfect love casteth out fear" is as true now as when the maxim
  was first given to the world.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Telling Their Love.</b>&mdash;The generality of the sex is love
  to be loved: how are they to know the fact that they <!-- Page 38
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>[38]</span>are loved unless
  they are told? To write a sensible love letter requires more talent than
  to solve, with your pen, a profound problem in philosophy. Lovers must
  not then expect much from each other's epistles.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Confidential.</b>&mdash;Ladies and gentlemen who correspond with
  each other should never be guilty of exposing any of the contents of any
  letters written expressing confidence, attachment or love. The man who
  confides in a lady and honors her with his confidence should be treated
  with perfect security and respect, and those who delight in showing their
  confidential letters to others are unworthy, heartless and unsafe
  companions.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Return of Letters.</b>&mdash;If letters were written under
  circumstances which no longer exist and all confidential relations are at
  an end, then all letters should be promptly returned.</p>

  <p>6. <b>How to Begin a Love Letter.</b>&mdash;How to begin a love letter
  has been no doubt the problem of lovers and suitors of all ages and
  nations. Fancy the youth of Young America with lifted pen, thinking how
  he shall address his beloved. Much depends upon this letter. What shall
  he say, and how shall he say it, is the great question. Perseverance,
  however, will solve the problem and determine results.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Forms of Beginning a Love Letter.</b>&mdash;Never say, "My
  Dearest Nellie," "My Adored Nellie," or "My Darling Nellie," until Nellie
  has first called you "My Dear," or has given you to understand that such
  familiar terms are permissible. As a rule a gentleman will never err if
  he says "Dear Miss Nellie," and if the letters are cordially reciprocated
  the "Miss" may in time be omitted, or other familiar terms used instead.
  In addressing a widow "Dear Madam," or, "My Dear Madam," will be a proper
  form until sufficient intimacy will justify the use of other terms.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Respect.</b>&mdash;A lady must always be treated with respectful
  delicacy, and a gentleman should never use the term "Dear" or "My Dear"
  under any circumstances unless he knows it is perfectly acceptable or a
  long and friendly acquaintance justifies it.</p>

  <p>9. <b>How to Finish a Letter.</b>&mdash;A letter will be suggested by
  the remarks on how to begin one. "Yours respectfully," "Yours truly,"
  "Yours sincerely," "Yours affectionately," "Yours ever affectionately,"
  "Yours most affectionately," "Ever yours," "Ever your own," or "Yours,"
  are all appropriate, each depending upon the beginning of the letter. It
  is difficult to see any phrase which could be added to them which would
  carry more meaning than they <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>[39]</span>contain. People can sign themselves
  "adorers" and such like, but they do so at the peril of good taste. It is
  not good that men or women "worship" each other&mdash;if they succeed in
  preserving reciprocal love and esteem they will have cause for great
  contentment.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Permission.</b>&mdash;No young man should ever write to a young
  lady any letter, formal or informal, unless he has first sought her
  permission to do so.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Special Forms.</b>&mdash;We give various forms or models of
  love letters to be <i>studied, not copied</i>. We have given no replies
  to the forms given, as every letter written will naturally suggest an
  answer. A careful study will be a great help to many who have not enjoyed
  the advantages of a literary education.</p>

  <p>Dear Harry:</p>

  <p>It is with great reluctance that I enter upon a subject which has
  given me great pain, and upon which silence has become impossible if I
  would preserve my self-respect. You cannot but be aware that I have just
  reason for saying that you have much displeased me. You have apparently
  forgotten what is due to me, circumstanced as we are, thus far at least.
  You cannot suppose that I can tamely see you disregard my feelings, by
  conduct toward other ladies from which I should naturally have the right
  to expect you to abstain. I am not so vulgar a person as to be jealous.
  When there is cause to infer changed feelings, or unfaithfulness to
  promises of constancy, jealousy is not the remedy. What the remedy is I
  need not say&mdash;we both of us have it in our hands. I am sure you will
  agree with me that we must come to some understanding by which the future
  shall be governed. Neither you nor I can bear a divided allegiance.
  Believe me that I write more in sorrow than in anger. You have made me
  very unhappy, and perhaps thoughtlessly. But it will take much to
  reassure me of your unaltered regard.</p>

  <p>1. It takes acquaintance to found a noble esteem, but politeness
  prepares the way. Indeed, as Montaigne says, Courtesy begets esteem at
  sight. Urbanity is half of affability, and affability is a charm worth
  possessing.</p>

  <p>2. A pleasing demeanor is often the scales by which the pagan weighs
  the Christian. It is not virtue, but virtue inspires it. There are
  circumstances in which it takes a great and strong soul to pass under the
  little yoke of courtesy, but it is a passport to a greater soul
  standard.</p>

  <p>3. Matthew Arnold says, "Conduct is three-fourths of character," and
  Christian benignity draws the line for conduct. A high sense of
  rectitude, a lowly soul, with a pure and kind <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[50]</span>heart are elements of
  nobility which will work out in the life of a human being at
  home&mdash;everywhere. "Private refinement makes public gentility."</p>

  <p>4. If you would conciliate the favor of men, rule your resentment.
  Remember that if you permit revenge or malice to occupy your soul, you
  are ruined.</p>

  <p>5. Cultivate a happy temper; banish the blues; a cheerful saguine
  spirit begets cheer and hope.</p>

  <p>6. Be trustworthy and be trustful.</p>

  <p>7. Do not place a light estimate upon the arts of good reading and
  good expression; they will yield perpetual interest.</p>

  <p>8. Study to keep versed in world events as well as in local
  occurrences, but abhor gossip, and above all scandal.</p>

  <p>9. Banish a self-conscience spirit&mdash;the source of much
  awkwardness&mdash;with a constant aim to make others happy. Remember that
  it is incumbent upon gentlemen and ladies alike to be neat in habits.</p>

  <p>10. The following is said to be a correct posture for walking. Head
  erect&mdash;not too <span class="correction" title="text reads `rigd'"
  >rigid</span>&mdash;chin in, shoulders back. Permit no unnecessary motion
  about the thighs. Do not lean over to one side in walking, standing or
  sitting; the practice is not only ungraceful, but it is deforming and
  therefore unhealthful.</p>

  <p>11. Beware of affectation and of Beau Brummel airs.</p>

  <p>12. If the hands are allowed to swing in walking, the arc should be
  limited, and the lady will manage them much more gracefully, if they
  almost touch the clothing.</p>

  <p>13. A lady should not stand with her hands behind her. We could almost
  say, forget the hands except to keep them clean, including the nails,
  cordial and helpful. One hand may rest easily in the other. Study repose
  of attitude here as well as in the rest of the body.</p>

  <p>14. Gestures are for emphasis in public speaking; do not point
  elsewhere, as a rule.</p>

  <p>15. Greet your acquaintances as you meet them with a slight bow and
  smile, as you speak.</p>

  <p>16. Look the person to whom you speak in the eye. Never under any
  circumstances wink at another or communicate by furtive looks.</p>

  <p>17. Should <span class="correction" title="text reads `yon'"
  >you</span> chance to be the rejected suitor of a lady, bear in mind your
  own self-respect, as well as the inexorable laws <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>[51]</span>of society, and bow
  politely when you meet her. Reflect that you do not stand before all
  woman-kind as you do at her bar. Do not resent the bitterness of
  flirtation. No lady or gentleman will flirt. Remember ever that painful
  prediscovery is better than later disappointment. Let such experience
  spur you to higher exertion.</p>

  <p>18. Discretion should be exercised in introducing persons. Of two
  gentlemen who are introduced, if one is superior in rank or age, he is
  the one to whom the introduction should be made. Of two social equals, if
  one be a stranger in the place, his name should be mentioned first.</p>

  <p>19. In general the simpler the introduction the better.</p>

  <p>20. Before introducing a gentleman to a lady, remember that she is
  entitled to hold you responsible for the acquaintance. The lady is the
  one to whom the gentleman is presented, which may be done thus: "Miss A,
  permit me to introduce to you my friend, Mr. B."; or, "Miss A., allow me
  to introduce Mr. B." If mutual and near friends of yours, say simply,
  "Miss A., Mr. B."</p>

  <p>21. Receive the introduction with a slight bow and the acknowledgment,
  "Miss A., I am happy to make your acquaintance"; or, "Mr. B., I am
  pleased to meet you." There is no reason why such stereotyped expressions
  should always be used, but something similar is expected. Do not extend
  the hand usually.</p>

  <p>22. A true lady will avoid familiarity in her deportment towards
  gentlemen. A young lady should not permit her gentlemen friends to
  address her by her home name, and the reverse is true. Use the title Miss
  and Mr. respectively.</p>

  <p>23. Ladies should be frank and cordial towards their lady friends, but
  never gushing.</p>

  <p>24. Should you meet a friend twice or oftener, at short intervals, it
  is polite to bow slightly each time after the first.</p>

  <p>25. A lady on meeting a gentleman with whom she has slight
  acquaintance will make a medium bow&mdash;neither too decided nor too
  slight or stiff.</p>

  <p>26. For a gentleman to take a young lady's arm, is to intimate that
  she is feeble, and young ladies resent the mode.</p>

  <p>27. If a young lady desires to visit any public place where she
  expects to meet a gentleman acquaintance, she should have a chaperon to
  accompany her, a person of mature years when possible, and never a giddy
  girl.</p>

  <p>28. A lady should not ask a gentleman to walk with her.</p>

<h3>A COMPLETE ETIQUETTE IN A FEW PRACTICAL RULES.</h3>

  <p><i>1. If you desire to be respected, keep clean. The finest attire and
  decorations will add nothing to the appearance or beauty of an untidy
  person.</i></p>

  <p><i>2. Clean clothing, clean skin, clean hands, including the nails,
  and clean, white teeth, are a requisite passport for good
  society.</i></p>

  <p><i>3. A bad breath should be carefully remedied, whether it proceeds
  from the stomach or from decayed teeth.</i></p>

  <p><i>4. To pick the nose, finger about the ears, or scratch the head or
  any other part of the person, in company, is decidedly vulgar.</i></p>

  <p><i>5. When you call at any private residence, do not neglect to clean
  your shoes thoroughly.</i></p>

  <p><i>6. A gentleman should always remove his hat in the presence of
  ladies, except out of doors, and then he should lift or touch his hat in
  salutation. On meeting a lady a well-bred gentleman will always lift his
  hat.</i></p>

  <p><i>7. An invitation to a lecture, concert, or other entertainment, may
  be either verbal or written, but should always be made at least
  twenty-four hours before the time.</i> <!-- Page 53 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>[53]</span></p>

  <p><i>8. On entering a hall or church the gentleman should precede the
  lady in walking up the aisle, or walk by her side, if the aisle is broad
  enough.</i></p>

  <p><i>9. A gentleman should always precede a lady upstairs, and follow
  her downstairs.</i></p>

  <p><i>10. Visitors should always observe the customs of the church with
  reference to standing, sitting, or kneeling during the services.</i></p>

  <p><i>11. On leaving a hall or church at the close of entertainment or
  services, the gentleman should precede the lady.</i></p>

  <p><i>12. A gentleman walking with a lady should carry the parcels, and
  never allow the lady to be burdened with anything of the kind.</i></p>

  <p><i>13. A gentleman meeting a lady on the street and wishing to speak
  to her, should never detain her, but may turn around and walk in the same
  direction she is going, until the conversation is completed.</i></p>

  <p><i>14. If a lady is traveling with a gentleman, simply as a friend,
  she should place the amount of her expenses in his hands, or insist on
  paying the bills herself.</i></p>

  <p><i>15. Never offer a lady costly gifts unless <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `yon'">you</span> are engaged to her, for it looks as
  if you were trying to purchase her goodwill; and when you make a present
  to a lady use no ceremony whatever.</i></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs055.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/055.jpg"
      alt="Teaching Good Manners." title="Teaching Good Manners." /></a>
    Children should early be taught the lesson of Propriety and Good
    Manners.
  </div>
  <p><i>16. Never carry on a private conversation in company. If secrecy is
  necessary, withdraw from the company.</i></p>

  <p><i>17. Never sit with your back to another without asking to be
  excused.</i></p>

  <p><i>18. It is as unbecoming for a gentleman to sit with legs crossed as
  it is for a lady.</i></p>

  <p><i>19. Never thrum with your fingers, rub your hands, yawn, or sigh
  aloud in company.</i></p>

  <p><i>20. Loud laughter, loud talking, or other boisterous manifestations
  should be checked in the society of others, especially on the street and
  in public places.</i> <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>[54]</span></p>

  <p><i>21. When you are asked to sing or play in company, do so without
  being urged, or refuse in a way that shall be final; and when music is
  being rendered in company, show politeness to the musician by giving
  attention. It is very impolite to keep up a conversation. If you do not
  enjoy the music, keep silent.</i></p>

  <p><i>22. Contentions, contradictions, etc., in society should be
  carefully avoided.</i></p>

  <p><i>23. Pulling out your watch in company, unless asked the time of
  day, is a mark of the demi-bred. It looks as if you were tired of the
  company and the time dragged heavily.</i></p>

  <p><i>24. You should never decline to be introduced to any one or all of
  the guests present at a party to which you have been invited.</i></p>

  <p><i>25. A gentleman who escorts a lady to a party, or who has a lady
  placed under his care, is under particular obligations to attend to her
  wants and see that she has proper attention. He should introduce her to
  others, and endeavor to make the evening pleasant. He should escort her
  to the supper table and provide for her wants.</i></p>

  <p><i>26. To take small children or dogs with you on a visit of ceremony
  is altogether vulgar, though in visiting familiar friends, children are
  not objectionable.</i></p>

<h3>ETIQUETTE OF CALLS.</h3>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

  </div>
  <p>In the matter of making calls it is the correct thing:</p>

  <p>For the caller who arrived first to leave first.</p>

  <p>To return a first call within a week and in person.</p>

  <p>To call promptly and in person after a first invitation.</p>

  <p>For the mother or chaperon to invite a gentleman to call.</p>

  <p>To call within a week after any entertainment to which one has been
  invited.</p>

  <p>You should call upon an acquaintance who has recently returned from a
  prolonged absence.</p>

  <p>It is proper to make the first call upon people in a higher social
  position, if one is asked to do so.</p>

  <p>It is proper to call, after an engagement has been announced, or a
  marriage has taken place, in the family.</p>

  <p>For the older residents in the city or street to call upon the
  newcomers to their neighborhood is a long recognized custom.</p>

  <p>It is proper, after a removal from one part of the city to another, to
  send out cards with one's new address upon them.</p>

  <p>To ascertain what are the prescribed hours for calling in the place
  where one is living, or making a visit, and to adhere to those hours is a
  duty that must not be overlooked.</p>

  <p>A gentleman should ask for the lady of the house as well as the young
  ladies, and leave cards for her as well as for the head of the family.

<hr class="short" >

<h3>ETIQUETTE ON THE STREET.</h3>

  <p>1. Your conduct on the street should always be modest and dignified.
  Ladies should carefully avoid all loud and boisterous conversation or
  laughter and all undue liveliness in public.</p>

  <p>2. When walking on the street do not permit yourself to be
  absent-minded, as to fail to recognize a friend; do not go along reading
  a book or newspaper.</p>

  <p>3. In walking with a lady on the street give her the inner side of the
  walk, unless the outside is the safer part; in which case she is entitled
  to it.</p>

  <p>4. Your arm should not be given to any lady except your wife or a near
  relative, or a very old lady, during the day, unless her comfort or
  safety requires it. At night the arm should always be offered; also in
  ascending the steps of a public building.</p>

  <p>5. In crossing the street a lady should gracefully raise her dress a
  little above her ankle with one hand. To raise the dress with both hands
  is vulgar, except in places where the mud is very deep.</p>

  <p>6. A gentleman meeting a lady acquaintance on the street should not
  presume to join her in her walk without first asking her permission.</p>

  <p>7. If you have anything to say to a lady whom you may happen to meet
  in the street, however intimate you may be, do not stop her, but turn
  round and walk in company with her; you can take leave at the end of the
  street.</p>

  <p>8. A lady should not venture out upon the street alone after dark. By
  so doing she compromises her dignity, and exposes herself to indignity at
  the hands of the rougher class.</p>

  <p>9. Never offer to shake hands with a lady in the street if you have on
  dark or soiled gloves, as you may soil hers.</p>

  <p>10. A lady does not form acquaintances upon the street, or seek to
  attract the attention of the other sex or of persons of her own sex. Her
  conduct is always modest and unassuming. Neither does a lady demand
  services or favors from a gentleman. She accepts them graciously, always
  <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>[60]</span>expressing her thanks. A gentleman will not
  stand on the street corners, or in hotel doorways, or store windows and
  gaze impertinently at ladies as they pass by. This is the exclusive
  business of loafers.</p>

  <p>11. In walking with a lady who has your arm, should you have to cross
  the street, do not disengage your arm and go around upon the outside,
  unless the lady's comfort renders it necessary. In walking with a lady,
  where it is necessary for you to proceed singly, always go before
  her.</p>

<hr class="short" >

<h3>ETIQUETTE BETWEEN SEXES.</h3>

  <p>1. A lady should be a lady, and a gentleman a gentleman under any and
  all circumstances.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Female Indifference to Man.</b>&mdash;There is nothing that
  affects the nature and pleasure of man so much as a proper and friendly
  recognition from a lady, and as women are more or less dependent upon
  man's good-will, either for gain or pleasure, it surely stands to their
  interest to be reasonably pleasant and courteous in his presence or
  society. Indifference is always a poor investment, whether in society or
  business.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Gallantry and Ladyism</b> should be a prominent feature in the
  education of young people. Politeness to ladies cultivates the intellect
  and refines the soul, and he who can be easy and entertaining in the
  society of ladies has mastered one of the greatest accomplishments. There
  is nothing taught in school, academy or college, that contributes so much
  to the happiness of man as a full development of his social and moral
  qualities.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Ladylike Etiquette.</b>&mdash;No woman can afford to treat men
  rudely. A lady must have a high intellectual and moral ideal and hold
  herself above reproach. She must remember that the art of pleasing and
  entertaining gentlemen is infinitely more ornamental than laces, ribbons
  or diamonds. Dress and glitter may please man, but it will never benefit
  him.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Cultivate Deficiencies.</b>&mdash;Men and women poorly sexed
  treat each other with more or less indifference, whereas a hearty
  sexuality inspires both to a right estimation of the faculties and
  qualities of each other. Those who are deficient should seek society and
  overcome their deficiencies. While some naturally inherit faculties as
  entertainers, others are compelled to acquire them by cultivation. <!--
  Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[61]</span></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

      alt="Asking an honest question." title="Asking an honest question." /></a>
    ASKING AN HONEST QUESTION.
  </div>
  <p>6. <b>Ladies' Society.</b>&mdash;He who seeks ladies' society should
  seek an education and should have a pure heart and a pure mind. Read
  good, pure and wholesome literature and study human nature, and you will
  always be a favorite in the society circle.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Woman Haters.</b>&mdash;Some men with little refinement and
  strong sensual feelings virtually insult and thereby disgust and repel
  every female they meet. They look upon woman with an inherent vulgarity,
  and doubt the virtue and integrity of all alike. But it is because they
  are generally <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>[62]</span>insincere and impure themselves, and with
  such a nature culture and refinement are out of the question, there must
  be a revolution.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Men Haters.</b>&mdash;Women who look upon all men as odious,
  corrupt or hateful, are no doubt so themselves, though they may be clad
  in silk and sparkle with diamonds and be as pretty as a lily; but their
  hypocrisy will out, and they can never win the heart of a faithful,
  conscientious and well balanced man. A good woman has broad ideas and
  great sympathy. She respects all men until they are proven unworthy.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Fond of Children.</b>&mdash;The man who is naturally fond of
  children will make a good husband and a good father. So it behooves the
  young man, to notice children and cultivate the art of pleasing them. It
  will be a source of interest, education and permanent benefit to all.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Excessive Luxury.</b>&mdash;Although the association with
  ladies is an expensive luxury, yet it is not an expensive education. It
  elevates, refines, sanctifies and purifies, and improves the whole man. A
  young man who has a pure and genuine respect for ladies, will not only
  make a good husband, but a good citizen as well.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Masculine Attention.</b>&mdash;No woman is entitled to any more
  attention than her loveliness and ladylike conduct will command. Those
  who are most pleasing will receive the most attention, and those who
  desire more should aspire to acquire more by cultivating those graces and
  virtues which ennoble woman, but no lady should lower or distort her own
  true ideal, or smother and crucify her conscience, in order to please any
  living man. A good man will admire a good woman, and deceptions cannot
  long be concealed. Her show of dry goods or glitter of jewels cannot long
  cover up her imperfections or deceptions.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Purity.</b>&mdash;Purity of purpose will solve all social
  problems. Let all stand on this exalted sexual platform, and teach every
  man just how to treat the female sex, and every woman how to behave
  towards the masculine; and it will incomparably adorn the manners of
  both, make both happy in each other, and mutually develop each other's
  sexuality and humanity.</p>

<h2>Practical Rules on Table Manners.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs064.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/064.jpg"
      alt="Table Manners." title="Table Manners." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>1. Help ladies with a due appreciation; do not overload the plate of
  any person you serve. Never pour gravy on a plate without permission. It
  spoils the meat for some persons.</p>

  <p>2. Never put anything by force upon any one's plate. It is extremely
  ill-bred, though extremely common, to press one to eat of anything.</p>

  <p>3. If at dinner you are requested to help any one to sauce or gravy,
  do not pour it over the meat or vegetables, but on one side of them.
  Never load down a person's plate with anything.</p>

  <p>4. As soon as you are helped, begin to eat, or at least begin to
  occupy yourself with what you have before you. Do not wait till your
  neighbors are served&mdash;a custom that was long ago abandoned.</p>

  <p>5. Should you, however, find yourself at a table where they have the
  old-fashioned steel forks, eat with your knife, as the others do, and do
  not let it be seen that you have any objection to doing so.</p>

  <p>6. Bread should be broken. To butter a large piece of bread and then
  bite it, as children do, is something the knowing never do. <!-- Page 64
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>[64]</span></p>

  <p>7. In eating game or poultry do not touch the bones with your fingers.
  To take a bone in the fingers for the purpose of picking it, is looked
  upon as being very inelegant.</p>

  <p>8. Never use your own knife or fork to help another. Use rather the
  knife or fork of the person you help.</p>

  <p>9. Never send your knife or fork, or either of them, on your plate
  when you send for second supply.</p>

  <p>10. Never turn your elbows out when you use your knife and fork. Keep
  them close to your sides.</p>

  <p>11. Whenever you use your fingers to convey anything to your mouth or
  to remove anything from the mouth, let it be the fingers of the left
  hand.</p>

  <p>12. Tea, coffee, chocolate and the like are drank from the cup and
  never from the saucer.</p>

  <p>13. In masticating your food, keep your mouth shut; otherwise you will
  make a noise that will be very offensive to those around you.</p>

  <p>14. Don't attempt to talk with a full mouth. One thing at a time is as
  much as any man can do well.</p>

  <p>15. Should you find a worm or insect in your food, say nothing about
  it.</p>

  <p>16. If a dish is distasteful to you, decline it, and without
  comment.</p>

  <p>17. Never put bones or bits of fruit on the table cloth. Put them on
  the side of your plate.</p>

  <p>18. Do not hesitate to take the last piece on the dish, simply because
  it is the last. To do so is to directly express the fear that you would
  exhaust the supply.</p>

  <p>19. If you would be what you would like to be&mdash;abroad, take care
  that you <i>are</i> what you would like to be&mdash;at home.</p>

  <p>20. Avoid picking your teeth at the table if possible; but if you
  must, do it, if you can, where you are not observed.</p>

  <p>21. If an accident of any kind soever should occur during dinner, the
  cause being who or what it may, you should not seem to note it.</p>

  <p>22. Should you be so unfortunate as to overturn or to break anything,
  you should make no apology. You might let your regret appear in your
  face, but it would not be proper to put it in words.</p>

    GIVING A PARLOR RECITATION.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Membership in Society.</b>&mdash;Many fail to get hold of the
  idea that they are members of society. They seem to suppose that the
  social machinery of the world is self-operating. They cast their first
  ballot with an emotion of pride, perhaps, but are sure to pay their first
  tax with a groan. They see political organizations in active existence;
  the parish, and the church, and other important bodies that embrace in
  some form of society all men, are successfully operated; and yet these
  young men have no part or lot in the matter. They do not think of giving
  a day's time to society.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Begin Early.</b>&mdash;One of the first things a young man
  should do is to see that he is acting his part in society. The earlier
  this is begun the better. I think that the opponents of secret societies
  in colleges have failed to estimate the benefit which it must be to every
  member to be obliged to contribute to the support of his particular
  organization, and to assume personal care and responsibility as a member.
  If these societies have a tendency to teach the lessons of which I speak,
  they are a blessed thing.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Do Your Part.</b>&mdash;Do your part, and be a man among men.
  Assume your portion of social responsibility, and see that you discharge
  it well. If you do not do this, then you are mean, and society has the
  right to despise you just as much as it chooses to do so. You are, to use
  a word more emphatic than agreeable, a sneak, and have not a claim upon
  your neighbors for a single polite word.</p>

  <p>4. <b>A Whining Complainer.</b>&mdash;Society, as it is called, is far
  more apt to pay its dues to the individual than the individual to
  society. Have you, young man, who are at home whining over the fact that
  you cannot get into society, done anything to give you a claim to social
  recognition? Are you able to make any return for social recognition and
  social privileges? Do you know anything? What kind of coin do you propose
  to pay in the discharge of the obligation which comes upon you with
  social recognition? In other words, as a return for what you wish to have
  society do for you, what can you do for society? This is a very important
  question&mdash;more important to you than to society. The question is,
  whether you will be a member of society by right, or by courtesy. If you
  have so mean a spirit as to be content to be a beneficiary of
  society&mdash;to receive favors and to confer none&mdash;you have no
  business in the society to which you aspire. You are an exacting,
  conceited fellow.</p>

  <p>5. <b>What Are You Good For?</b>&mdash;Are you a good beau, and are
  you willing to make yourself useful in waiting on the <!-- Page 67
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[67]</span>ladies on all
  occasions? Have you a good set of teeth, which you are willing to show
  whenever the wit of the company gets off a good thing? Are you a true,
  straightforward, manly fellow, with whose healthful and uncorrupted
  nature it is good for society to come in contact? In short, do you
  possess anything of any social value? If you do, and are willing to
  impart it, society will yield itself to your touch. If you have nothing,
  then society, as such, owes you nothing. Christian philanthropy may put
  its arm around you, as a lonely young man, about to spoil for want of
  something, but it is very sad and humiliating for a young man to be
  brought to that. There are people who devote themselves to nursing young
  men, and doing them good. If they invite you to tea, go by all means, and
  try your hand. If, in the course of the evening, you can prove to them
  that your society is desirable, you have won a point. Don't be
  patronized.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Morbid Condition.</b>&mdash;Young men, you are apt to get
  into a morbid state of mind, which declines them to social intercourse.
  They become devoted to business with such exclusiveness, that all social
  intercourse is irksome. They go out to tea as if they were going to jail,
  and drag themselves to a party as to an execution. This disposition is
  thoroughly morbid, and to be overcome by going where you are invited,
  always, and with a sacrifice of feeling.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Common Blunder.</b>&mdash;Don't shrink from contact with
  anything but bad morals. Men who affect your unhealthy minds with
  antipathy, will prove themselves very frequently to be your best friends
  and most delightful companions. Because a man seems uncongenial to you,
  who are squeamish and foolish, you have no right to shun him. We become
  charitable by knowing men. We learn to love those whom we have despised
  by rubbing against them. Do you not remember some instance of meeting a
  man or woman whom you had never previously known or cared to
  know&mdash;an individual, perhaps, against whom you have entertained the
  strongest prejudices&mdash;but to whom you became bound by a lifelong
  friendship through the influence of a three days' intercourse? Yet, if
  you had not thus met, you would have carried through life the idea that
  it would be impossible for you to give your fellowship to such an
  individual.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Foolishness of Man.</b>&mdash;God has introduced into human
  character infinite variety, and for you to say that you do not love and
  will not associate with a man because he is unlike you, is not only
  foolish but wrong. You are to remember that in the precise manner and
  decree in which <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page68"></a>[68]</span>a man differs from you, do you differ from
  him; and that from his standpoint you are naturally as repulsive to him,
  as he, from your standpoint, is to you. So, leave all this talk of
  congeniality to silly girls and transcendental dreamers.</p>

    GATHERING ORANGES IN THE SUNNY SOUTH.
  </div>
  <p>9. <b>Do Business in Your Way and Be Honest.</b>&mdash;Do your
  business in your own way, and concede to every man the privilege which
  you claim for yourself. The more you mix with men, the less you will be
  disposed to quarrel, and the more charitable and liberal will you become.
  The fact that you do not understand a man, is quite as likely to be your
  fault as his. There are a good many chances in favor of the conclusion
  that, if you fail to like an individual whose acquaintance you make it is
  through your own ignorance and illiberality. So I say, meet every man
  honestly; seek to know him; and you will find that in those points in
  which he differs from you rests his power to instruct you, enlarge you,
  and do you good. Keep your heart open for everybody, and be sure that you
  shall have your reward. You shall find a jewel under the most uncouth
  exterior; and associated with homeliest manners and oddest ways and
  ugliest faces, you will find rare virtues, fragrant little humanities,
  and inspiring heroisms.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Without Society, Without Influence.</b>&mdash;Again: you can
  have no influence unless you are social. An unsocial man is as devoid of
  influence as an ice-peak is of verdure. It is through social contact and
  absolute social value alone that you can accomplish any great social
  good. It is through the invisible lines which you are able to attach to
  the minds with which you are brought into association alone that you can
  tow society, with its deeply freighted interests, to the great haven of
  your hope.</p>

  <p>11. <b>The Revenge of Society.</b>&mdash;The revenge which society
  takes upon the man who isolates himself, is as terrible as it is
  inevitable. The pride which sits alone will have the privilege of sitting
  alone in its sublime disgust till it drops into the grave. The world
  sweeps by the man, carelessly, remorselessly, contemptuously. He has no
  hold upon society, because he is no part of it.</p>

  <p>12. <b>The Conclusion of the Whole Matter.</b>&mdash;You cannot move
  men until you are one of them. They will not follow you until they have
  heard your voice, shaken your hand, and fully learned your principles and
  your sympathies. It makes no difference how much you know, or how much
  you are capable of doing. You may pile accomplishment upon acquisition
  mountain high; but if you fail to be a social man, demonstrating to
  society that your lot is with the rest, a <!-- Page 69 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>[69]</span>little child with a song
  in its mouth, and a kiss for all and a pair of innocent hands to lay upon
  the knees, shall lead more hearts and change the direction of more lives
  than you.</p>

<h2>Politeness.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Beautiful Behavior.</b>&mdash;Politeness has been described as
  the art of showing, by external signs, the internal regard we have for
  others. But one may be perfectly polite to another without necessarily
  paying a special regard for him. Good manners are neither more nor less
  than beautiful behavior. It has been well said that "a beautiful form is
  better than a beautiful face, and a beautiful behavior is better than a
  beautiful form; it gives a higher pleasure than statues or
  pictures&mdash;it is the finest of the fine arts."</p>

  <p>2. <b>True Politeness.</b>&mdash;The truest politeness comes of
  sincerity. It must be the outcome of the heart, or it will make no
  lasting impression; for no amount of polish can dispense with
  truthfulness. The natural character must be allowed to appear, freed of
  its angularities and asperities. Though politeness, in its best form,
  should resemble water&mdash;"best when clearest, most simple, and without
  taste"&mdash;yet genius in a man will always cover many defects of
  manner, and much will be excused to the strong and the original. Without
  genuineness and individuality, human life would lose much of its interest
  and variety, as well as its manliness and robustness of character.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Personality of Others.</b>&mdash;True politeness especially
  exhibits itself in regard for the personality of others. A man will
  respect the individuality of another if he wishes to be respected
  himself. He will have due regard for his views and opinions, even though
  they differ from his own. The well-mannered man pays a compliment to
  another, and sometimes even secures his respect by patiently listening to
  him. He is simply tolerant and forbearant, and refrains from judging
  harshly; and harsh judgments of others will almost invariably provoke
  harsh judgments of ourselves.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Impolite.</b>&mdash;The impolite, impulsive man will,
  however, sometimes rather lose his friend than his joke. He may surely be
  pronounced a very foolish person who secures another's hatred at the
  price of a moment's gratification. It was a saying of Burnel, the
  engineer&mdash;himself one of the kindest-natured of men&mdash;that
  "spite and ill-nature are among the most expensive luxuries in life." Dr.
  Johnson once said: "Sir, a man has no more right to say a rude thing to
  another than to knock him down."</p>

  <p>5. <b>Feelings of Others.</b>&mdash;Want of respect for the feelings
  of others usually originates in selfishness, and issues in <!-- Page 71
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>[71]</span>hardness and
  repulsiveness of manner. It may not proceed from malignity so much, as
  from want of sympathy, and want of delicacy&mdash;a want of that
  perception of, and attention to, those little and apparently trifling
  things, by which pleasure is given or pain occasioned to others. Indeed,
  it may be said that in self-sacrifice in the ordinary intercourse of
  life, mainly consists the difference between being well and ill bred.
  Without some degree of self-restraint in society a man may be found
  almost insufferable. No one has pleasure in holding intercourse with such
  a person, and he is a constant source of annoyance to those about
  him.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Disregard of Others.</b>&mdash;Men may show their disregard to
  others in various impolite ways, as, for instance, by neglect of
  propriety in dress, by the absence of cleanliness, or by indulging in
  repulsive habits. The slovenly, dirty person, by rendering himself
  physically disagreeable, sets the tastes and feelings of others at
  defiance, and is rude and uncivil, only under another form.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Best School of Politeness.</b>&mdash;The first and best
  school of politeness, as of character, is always the home, where woman is
  the teacher. The manners of society at large are but the reflex of the
  manners of our collective homes, neither better nor worse. Yet, with all
  the disadvantages of ungenial homes, men may practice self-culture of
  manner as of intellect, and learn by good examples to cultivate a
  graceful and agreeable behavior towards others. Most men are like so many
  gems in the rough, which need polishing by contact with other and better
  natures, to bring out their full beauty and lustre. Some have but one
  side polished, sufficient only to show the delicate graining of the
  interior; but to bring out the full qualities of the gem, needs the
  discipline of experience, and contact with the best examples of character
  in the intercourse of daily life.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Captiousness of Manner.</b>&mdash;While captiousness of manner,
  and the habit of disputing and contradicting every thing said, is
  chilling and repulsive, the opposite habit of assenting to, and
  sympathizing with, every statement made, or emotion expressed, is almost
  equally disagreeable. It is unmanly, and is felt to be dishonest. "It may
  seem difficult," says Richard Sharp, "to steer always between bluntness
  and plain dealing, between merited praises and lavishing indiscriminate
  flattery; but it is very easy&mdash;good humor, kindheartedness, and
  perfect simplicity, being all that are requisite to do what is right in
  the right way." At the same time many are impolite, not because they mean
  to be so, but because they are awkward, and perhaps know no better. <!--
  Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>[72]</span></p>

  <p>9. <b>Shy People.</b>&mdash;Again many persons are thought to be
  stiff, reserved, and proud, when they are only shy. Shyness is
  characteristic of most people of the Teutonic race. From all that can be
  learned of Shakespeare, it is to be inferred that he was an exceedingly
  shy man. The manner in which his plays were sent into the world&mdash;for
  it is not known that he edited or authorized the publication of a single
  one of them,&mdash;and the dates at which they respectively appeared, are
  mere matters of conjecture.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Self-Forgetfulness.</b>&mdash;True politeness is best evinced
  by self-forgetfulness, or self-denial in the interest of others. Mr.
  Garfield, our martyred president, was a gentleman of royal type. His
  friend, Col. Rockwell, says of him: "In the midst of his suffering he
  never forgets others. For instance, to-day he said to me, 'Rockwell,
  there is a poor soldier's widow who came to me before this thing
  occurred, and I promised her, she should be provided for. I want you to
  see that the matter is attended to at once.' He is the most docile
  patient I ever saw."</p>

  <p>11. <b>Its Bright Side.</b>&mdash;We have thus far spoken of shyness
  as a defect. But there is another way of looking at it; for even shyness
  has its bright side, and contains an element of good. Shy men and shy
  races are ungraceful and undemonstrative, because, as regards society at
  large, they are comparatively unsociable. They do not possess those
  elegancies of manner acquired by free intercourse, which distinguish the
  social races, because their tendency is to shun society rather than to
  seek it. They are shy in the presence of strangers, and shy even in their
  own families. They hide their affections under a robe of reserve, and
  when they do give way to their feelings, it is only in some very hidden
  inner chamber. And yet, the feelings are there, and not the less healthy
  and genuine, though they are not made the subject of exhibition to
  others.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Worthy of Cultivation.</b>&mdash;While, therefore, grace of
  manner, politeness of behavior, elegance of demeanor, and all the arts
  that contribute to make life pleasant and beautiful, are worthy of
  cultivation, it must not be at the expense of the more solid and enduring
  qualities of honesty, sincerity, and truthfulness. The fountain of beauty
  must be in the heart more than in the eye, and if it does not tend to
  produce beautiful life and noble practice, it will prove of comparatively
  little avail. Politeness of manner is not worth much, unless it is
  accompanied by polite actions.</p>

<h2>Influence of Good Character.</h2>

  </div>
<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Character is moral order seen through the medium of an individual
  nature&mdash;Men of character are the conscience of the society to which
  they belong."&mdash;<span class="sc">Emerson</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The purest treasure mortal times afford,</p>
      <p>Is&mdash;spotless reputation; that away,</p>
      <p>Men are but gilded loam, or painted clay.</p>
      <p>A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest</p>
      <p>Is&mdash;a bold Spirit in a loyal breast.&mdash;<span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Reputation.</b>&mdash;The two most precious things this side the
  grave are our reputation and our life. But it is to be lamented that the
  most contemptible whisper may deprive us of the one, and the weakest
  weapon of the other. A wise man, therefore, will be more anxious to
  deserve a fair name than to possess it, and this will teach him so to
  live, as not to be afraid to die.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Character.</b>&mdash;Character is one of the greatest motive
  powers in the world. In its noblest embodiments, it exemplifies human
  nature in its highest forms, for it exhibits man at his best.</p>

  <p>3. <b>The Heart That Rules in Life.</b>&mdash;Although genius always
  commands admiration, character most secures respect. The former is more
  the product of brain power, the latter of heart power; and in the long
  run it is the heart that rules in life. Men of genius stand to society in
  the relation of its intellect as men of character of its conscience: and
  while the former are admired, the latter are followed.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Highest Ideal of Life and Character.</b>&mdash;Commonplace
  though it may appear, this doing of one's duty embodies the highest ideal
  of life and character. There may be nothing heroic about it; but the
  common lot of men is not heroic. And though the abiding sense of duty
  upholds man in his highest attitudes, it also equally sustains him in the
  transaction of the ordinary affairs of every-day existence. Man's life is
  "centered in the sphere of common duties." The most influential of all
  the virtues are those which are the most in request for daily use. They
  wear the best, and last the longest.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Wealth.</b>&mdash;Wealth in the hands of men of weak purpose, or
  deficient self-control, or of ill regulated passions, is <!-- Page 74
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>[74]</span>only a
  temptation and a snare&mdash;the source, it may be, of infinite mischief
  to themselves, and often to others.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, a condition of comparative poverty is compatible with
  character in its highest form. A man may possess only his industry, his
  frugality, his integrity, and yet stand high in the rank of true manhood.
  The advice which Burns' father gave him was the best:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"He bade me act a manly part, though I had ne'er a farthing,</p>
      <p>For without an honest, manly heart no man was worth regarding."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>6. <b>Character is Property.</b>&mdash;It is the noblest of
  possessions. It is an estate in the general good-will and respect of men;
  they who invest in it&mdash;though they may not become rich in this
  world's goods&mdash;will find their reward in esteem and reputation
  fairly and honorably won. And it is right that in life good qualities
  should tell&mdash;that industry, virtue, and goodness should rank the
  highest&mdash;and that the really best men should be foremost.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Simple Honesty of Purpose.</b>&mdash;This in a man goes a long
  way in life, if founded on a just estimate of himself and a steady
  obedience to the rule he knows and feels to be right. It holds a man
  straight, gives him strength and sustenance, and forms a mainspring of
  vigorous action. No man is bound to be rich or great&mdash;no, nor to be
  wise&mdash;but every man is bound to be honest and virtuous.</p>

    HEAVENLY MUSIC.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Gentleness Must Characterize Every Act of
  Authority.</b>&mdash;The storm of excitement that may make the child
  start, bears no relation to actual obedience. The inner firmness, that
  sees and feels a moral conviction and expects obedience, is only
  disguised and defeated by bluster. The more calm and direct it is, the
  greater certainty it has of dominion.</p>

  <p>2. <b>For the Government of Small Children.</b>&mdash;For the
  government of small children speak only in the authority of love, yet
  authority, loving and to be obeyed. The most important lesson to impart
  is obedience to authority as authority. The question of salvation with
  most children will be settled as soon as they learn to obey parental
  authority. It establishes a habit and order of mind that is ready to
  accept divine authority. This precludes skepticism and disobedience, and
  induces that childlike trust and spirit set forth as a necessary state of
  salvation. Children that are never made to obey are left to drift into
  the sea of passion where the pressure for surrender only tends to drive
  them at greater speed from the haven of safety.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Habits of Self-Denial.</b>&mdash;Form in the child habits of
  self-denial. Pampering never matures good character.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Emphasize Integrity.</b>&mdash;Keep the moral tissues tough in
  integrity; then it will hold a hook of obligations when once set in a
  sure place. There is nothing more vital. Shape all your experiments to
  preserve the integrity. Do not so reward it that it becomes mercenary.
  Turning State's evidence is a dangerous experiment in morals. Prevent
  deceit from succeeding.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Guard Modesty.</b>&mdash;To be brazen is to imperil some of the
  best elements of character. Modesty may be strengthened into a becoming
  confidence, but brazen facedness can seldom be toned down into decency.
  It requires the miracle of grace.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Protect Purity.</b>&mdash;Teach your children to loathe
  impurity. Study the character of their playmates. Watch their books. Keep
  them from corruption at all cost. The groups of youth in the school and
  in society, and in business places, seed with improprieties of word and
  thought. Never relax your vigilance along this exposed border.</p>

    BOTH PUZZLED.
  </div>
  <p>7. <b>Threaten the Least Possible.</b>&mdash;In family government
  threaten the least possible. Some parents rattle off their commands with
  penalties so profusely that there is a steady <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>[78]</span>roar of hostilities about
  the child's head. These threats are forgotten by the parent and unheeded
  by the child. All government is at an end.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Do Not Enforce Too Many Commands.</b>&mdash;Leave a few things
  within the range of the child's knowledge that are not forbidden. Keep
  your word good, but do not have too much of it out to be redeemed.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Punish as Little as Possible.</b>&mdash;Sometimes punishment is
  necessary, but the less it is resorted to the better.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Never Punish in a Passion.</b>&mdash;Wrath only becomes
  cruelty. There is no moral power in it. When you seem to be angry you can
  do no good.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Brutish Violence Only Multiplies Offenders.</b>&mdash;Striking
  and beating the body seldom reaches the soul. Fear and hatred beget
  rebellion.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Punish Privately.</b>&mdash;Avoid punishments that break down
  self-respect. Striking the body produces shame and indignation. It is
  enough for the other children to know that discipline is being
  administered.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Never Stop Short of Success.</b>&mdash;When the child is not
  conquered the punishment has been worse than wasted. Reach the point
  where neither wrath nor sullenness remain. By firm persistency and
  persuasion require an open look of recognition and peace. It is only evil
  to stir up the devil unless he is cast out. Ordinarily one complete
  victory will last a child for a lifetime. But if the child relapses,
  repeat the dose with proper accompaniments.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Do Not Require Children to Complain of Themselves for
  Pardon.</b>&mdash;It begets either sycophants or liars. It is the part of
  the government to detect offences. It reverses the order of matters to
  shirk this duty.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Grade Authority Up to Liberty.</b>&mdash;The growing child must
  have experiments of freedom. Lead him gently into the family. Counsel
  with him. Let him plan as he can. By and by he has the confidence of
  courage without the danger of exposures.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Respect.</b>&mdash;Parents must respect each other. Undermining
  either undermines both. Always govern in the spirit of love.</p>

<h3>Home Lessons in Conversation.</h3>

  <p>Say nothing unpleasant when it can be avoided.</p>

  <p>Avoid satire and sarcasm.</p>

  <p>Never repeat a word that was not intended for repetition.</p>

  <p>Cultivate the supreme wisdom, which consists less in saying what ought
  to be said than in not saying what ought not to be said.</p>

  <p>Often cultivate "flashes of silence."</p>

  <p>It is the larger half of the conversation to listen well.</p>

  <p>Listen to others patiently, especially the poor.</p>

  <p>Sharp sayings are an evidence of low breeding.</p>

  <p>Shun faultfindings and faultfinders.</p>

  <p>Never utter an uncomplimentary word against anyone.</p>

  <p>Compliments delicately hinted and sincerely intended are a grace in
  conversation.</p>

  <p>Commendation of gifts and cleverness properly put are in good taste,
  but praise of beauty is offensive.</p>

  <p>Repeating kind expressions is proper.</p>

  <p>Compliments given in a joke may be gratefully received in earnest.</p>

  <p>The manner and tone are important parts of a compliment.</p>

  <p>Avoid egotism.</p>

  <p>Don't talk of yourself, or of your friends or your deeds.</p>

  <p>Give no sign that you appreciate your own merits.</p>

  <p>Do not become a distributer of the small talk of a community. The
  smiles of your auditors do not mean respect.</p>

  <p>Avoid giving the impression of one filled with "suppressed
  egotism."</p>

  <p>Never mention your own peculiarities; for culture destroys vanity.</p>

  <p>Avoid exaggeration.</p>

  <p>Do not be too positive.</p>

  <p>Do not talk of display oratory.</p>

  <p>Do not try to lead in conversation, looking around to enforce
  silence.</p>

  <p>Lay aside affected silly etiquette for the natural dictates of the
  heart.</p>

  <p>Direct the conversation where others can join with you and impart to
  you useful information.</p>

  <p>Avoid oddity. Eccentricity is shallow vanity.</p>

  <p>Be modest.</p>

  <p>Be what you wish to seem.</p>

  <p>Avoid repeating a brilliant or clever saying.</p>

    THINKING ONLY OF DRESS.
  </div>
  <p>If you find bashfulness or embarrassment coming upon you, do or say
  something at once. The commonest matter gently stated is better than an
  embarrassing silence. Sometimes changing your position, or looking into a
  book for a moment may relieve your embarrassment, and dispel any settling
  stiffness.</p>

  <p>Avoid telling many stories, or repeating a story more than once in the
  same company.</p>

  <p>Never treat any one as if you simply wanted him to tell stories.
  People laugh and despise such a one.</p>

  <p>Never tell a coarse story. No wit or preface can make it
  excusable.</p>

  <p>Tell a story, if at all, only as an illustration, and not for itself.
  Tell it accurately.</p>

  <p>Be careful in asking questions for the purpose of starting
  conversation or drawing out a person, not to be rude or intrusive.</p>

  <p>Never take liberties by staring, or by any rudeness.</p>

  <p>Never infringe upon any established regulations among strangers.</p>

  <p>Do not always prove yourself to be the one in the right. The right
  will appear. You need only give it a chance.</p>

  <p>Avoid argument in conversation. It is discourteous to your host.</p>

  <p>Cultivate paradoxes in conversation with your peers. They add interest
  to common-place matters. To strike the harmless faith of ordinary people
  in any public idol is waste, but such a movement with those able to reply
  is better.</p>

  <p>Never discourse upon your ailments.</p>

  <p>Never use words of the meaning or pronunciation of which you are
  uncertain.</p>

  <p>Avoid discussing your own or other people's domestic concerns.</p>

  <p>Never prompt a slow speaker, as if you had all the ability. In
  conversing with a foreigner who may be learning our language, it is
  excusable to help him in some delicate way.</p>

  <p>Never give advice unasked.</p>

  <p>Do not manifest impatience.</p>

  <p>Do not interrupt another when speaking.</p>

  <p>Do not find fault, though you may gently criticise.</p>

  <p>Do not appear to notice inaccuracies of speech in others.</p>

  <p>Do not always commence a conversation by allusion to the weather.</p>

  <p>Do not, when narrating an incident, continually say, "you see," "you
  know." <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>[83]</span></p>

  <p>Do not allow yourself to lose temper or speak excitedly.</p>

  <p>Do not introduce professional or other topics that the company
  generally cannot take an interest in.</p>

  <p>Do not talk very loud. A firm, clear, distinct, yet mild, gentle, and
  musical voice has great power.</p>

  <p>Do not be absent-minded, requiring the speaker to repeat what has been
  said that you may understand.</p>

  <p>Do not try to force yourself into the confidence of others.</p>

  <p>Do not use profanity, vulgar terms, words of double meaning, or
  language that will bring the blush to anyone.</p>

  <p>Do not allow yourself to speak ill of the absent one if it can be
  avoided. The day may come when some friend will be needed to defend you
  in your absence.</p>

  <p>Do not speak with contempt and ridicule of a locality which you may be
  visiting. Find something to truthfully praise and commend; thus make
  yourself agreeable.</p>

  <p>Do not make a pretense of gentility, nor parade the fact that you are
  a descendant of any notable family. You must pass for just what you are,
  and must stand on your own merit.</p>

  <p>Do not contradict. In making a correction say, "I beg your pardon, but
  I had the impression that it was so and so." Be careful in contradicting,
  as you may be wrong yourself.</p>

  <p>Do not be unduly familiar; you will merit contempt if you are. Neither
  should you be dogmatic in your assertions, arrogating to yourself such
  consequences in your opinions.</p>

  <p>Do not be too lavish in your praise of various members of your own
  family when speaking to strangers; the person to whom you are speaking
  may know some faults that you do not.</p>

  <p>Do not feel it incumbent upon yourself to carry your point in
  conversation. Should the person with whom you are conversing feel the
  same, your talk may lead into violent argument.</p>

  <p>Do not try to pry into the private affairs of others by asking what
  their profits are, what things cost, whether Melissa ever had a beau, and
  why Amarette never got married? All such questions are extremely
  impertinent and are likely to meet with rebuke.</p>

  <p>Do not whisper in company; do not engage in private conversation; do
  not speak a foreign language which the general company present may not
  understand, unless it is understood that the foreigner is unable to speak
  your own language.</p>

    Widower Jones and Widow Smith.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Good Appearance.</b>&mdash;The first care of all persons should
  be for their personal appearance. Those who are slovenly or careless in
  their habits are unfit for refined society, and cannot possibly make a
  good appearance in it. A well-bred person will always cultivate habits of
  the most scrupulous neatness. A gentleman or lady is always well dressed.
  The garment may be plain or of coarse material, or even worn "thin and
  shiny," but if it is carefully brushed and neat it can be worn with
  dignity. <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85"></a>[85]</span></p>

  <p>2. <b>Personal Cleanliness.</b>&mdash;Personal appearance depends
  greatly on the careful toilet and scrupulous attention to dress. The
  first point which marks the gentleman or lady in appearance is rigid
  cleanliness. This remark supplies to the body and everything which covers
  it. A clean skin&mdash;only to be secured by frequent baths&mdash;is
  indispensable.</p>

  <p>3. <b>The Teeth.</b>&mdash;The teeth should receive the utmost
  attention. Many a young man has been disgusted with a lady by seeing her
  unclean and discolored teeth. It takes but a few moments, and if
  necessary secure some simple tooth powder or rub the teeth thoroughly
  every day with a linen handkerchief, and it will give the teeth and mouth
  a beautiful and clean appearance.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Hair and Beard.</b>&mdash;The hair should be thoroughly
  brushed and well kept, and the beard of men properly trimmed. Men should
  not let their hair grow long and shaggy.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Underclothing.</b>&mdash;The matter of cleanliness extends to
  all articles of clothing, underwear as well as the outer clothing.
  Cleanliness is a mark of true utility. The clothes need not necessarily
  be of a rich and expensive quality, but they can all be kept clean. Some
  persons have an odor about them that is very offensive, simply on account
  of their underclothing being worn too long without washing. This odor of
  course cannot be detected by the person who wears the soiled garments,
  but other persons easily detect it and are offended by it.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Bath.</b>&mdash;No person should think for a moment that
  they can be popular in society without regular bathing. A bath should be
  taken at least once a week, and if the feet perspire they should be
  washed several times a week, as the case may require. It is not
  unfrequent that young men are seen with dirty ears and neck. This is
  unpardonable and boorish, and shows gross neglect. Occasionally a young
  lady will be called upon unexpectedly when her neck and smiling face are
  not emblems of cleanliness. Every lady owes it to herself to be
  fascinating; every gentleman is bound, for his own sake, to be
  presentable; but beyond this there is the obligation to society, to one's
  friends, and to those with whom we may be brought in contact.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Soiled Garments.</b>&mdash;A young man's garments may not be
  expensive, yet there is no excuse for wearing a soiled collar and a
  soiled shirt, or carrying a soiled handkerchief. No one should appear as
  though he had slept in a stable, shaggy hair, soiled clothing or garments
  indifferently put on and carelessly buttoned. A young man's vest should
  always be kept buttoned in the presence of ladies. <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>[86]</span></p>

  <p>8. <b>The Breath.</b>&mdash;Care should be taken to remedy an
  offensive breath without delay. Nothing renders one so unpleasant to
  one's acquaintance, or is such a source of misery to one's self. The evil
  may be from some derangement of the stomach or some defective condition
  of the teeth, or catarrhal affection of the throat and nose. See remedies
  in other portions of the book.</p>

<h3>A YOUNG MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Dress changes the manners.&mdash;<span class="sc">Voltaire</span>.</p>

  <p>Whose garments wither, shall receive faded smiles.&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Sheridan Knowles</span>.</p>

  <p>Men of sense follow fashion so far that they are neither conspicuous
  for their excess nor peculiar by their opposition to it.&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Anonymous</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>1. A well-dressed man does not require so much an extensive as a
  varied wardrobe. He does not need a different suit for every season and
  every occasion, but if he is careful to select clothes that are simple
  and not striking or conspicuous, he may use the garment over and over
  again without their being noticed, provided they are suitable to the
  season and the occasion.</p>

  <p>2. A clean shirt, collar and cuffs always make a young man look neat
  and tidy, even if his clothes are not of the latest pattern and are
  somewhat threadbare.</p>

  <p>3. Propriety is outraged when a man of sixty dresses like a youth of
  sixteen. It is bad manners for a gentleman to use perfumes to a
  noticeable extent. Avoid affecting singularity in dress. Expensive
  clothes are no sign of a gentleman.</p>

    The Dude of the 17th Century.
  </div>
  <p>4. When dressed for company, strive to appear easy and natural.
  Nothing is more distressing to a sensitive person, or more ridiculous to
  one gifted with refinement, than to see a lady laboring under the
  consciousness of a fine gown; or a gentleman who is stiff, awkward and
  ungainly in a brand-new coat.</p>

  <p>5. Avoid what is called the "ruffianly style of dress" or the slouchy
  appearance of a half-unbottoned vest, and suspenderless pantaloons. That
  sort of affectation is, if possible, even more disgusting than the
  painfully elaborate frippery of the dandy or dude. Keep your clothes well
  brushed and keep them cleaned. Slight spots can be removed with a little
  sponge and soap and water.</p>

  <p>6. A gentleman should never wear a high hat unless he has on a frock
  coat or a dress suit.</p>

  <p>7. A man's jewelry should be good and simple. Brass or false jewelry,
  like other forms of falsehood, is vulgar. Wearing many cheap decorations
  is a serious fault. <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page87"></a>[87]</span></p>

  <p>8. If a man wears a ring it should be on the third finger of the left
  hand. This is the only piece of jewelry a man is allowed to wear that
  does not serve a purpose.</p>

  <p>9. Wearing imitations of diamonds is always in very bad taste.</p>

  <p>10. Every man looks better in a full beard it he keeps it well
  trimmed. If a man shaves he should shave at least every other day, unless
  he is in the country.</p>

  <p>11. The finger-nails should be kept cut, and the teeth should be
  cleaned every morning, and kept clear from tartar. A man who does not
  keep his teeth clean does not look like a gentleman when he shows
  them.</p>

      alt="Dinner Party." title="Dinner Party." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>God is a Lover of Dress.</b>&mdash;We cannot but feel that God
  is a lover of dress. He has put on robes of beauty and glory upon all his
  works. Every flower is dressed in richness; every field blushes beneath a
  mantle of beauty; every star is veiled in brightness; every bird is
  clothed in the <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page89"></a>[89]</span>habiliments of the most exquisite taste. The
  cattle upon the thousand hills are dressed by the hand divine. Who,
  studying God in his works, can doubt, that he will smile upon the
  evidence of correct taste manifested by his children in clothing the
  forms he has made them?</p>

  <p>2. <b>Love of Dress.</b>&mdash;To love dress is not to be a slave of
  fashion; to love dress only is the test of such homage. To transact the
  business of charity in a silken dress, and to go in a carriage to the
  work, injures neither the work nor the worker. The slave of fashion is
  one who assumes the livery of a princess, and then omits the errand of
  the good human soul; dresses in elegance, and goes upon no good errand,
  and thinks and does nothing of value to mankind.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Beauty in Dress.</b>&mdash;Beauty in dress is a good thing, rail
  at it who may. But it is a lower beauty, for which a higher beauty should
  not be sacrificed. They love dresses too much who give it their first
  thought, their best time, or all their money; who for it neglect the
  culture of their mind or heart, or the claims of others on their service;
  who care more for their dress than their disposition; who are troubled
  more by an unfashionable bonnet than a neglected duty.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Simplicity of Dress.</b>&mdash;Female lovliness never appears to
  so good advantage as when set off by simplicity of dress. No artist ever
  decks his angels with towering feathers and gaudy jewelry; and our dear
  human angels&mdash;if they would make good their title to that
  name&mdash;should carefully avoid ornaments, which properly belong to
  Indian squaws and African princesses. These tinselries may serve to give
  effect on the stage, or upon the ball room floor, but in daily life there
  is no substitute for the charm of simplicity. A vulgar taste is not to be
  disguised by gold or diamonds. The absence of a true taste and refinement
  of delicacy cannot be compensated for by the possession of the most
  princely fortune. Mind measures gold, but gold cannot measure mind.
  Through dress the mind may be read, as through the delicate tissue the
  lettered page. A modest woman will dress modestly; a really refined and
  intelligent woman will bear the marks of careful selection and faultless
  taste.</p>

  <p>5. <b>People of Sense.</b>&mdash;A coat that has the mark of use upon
  it, is a recommendation to the people of sense, and a hat with too much
  nap, and too high lustre, a derogatory circumstance. The best coats in
  our streets are worn on the backs of penniless fops, broken down
  merchants, clerks with pitiful salaries, and men that do not pay up. The
  heaviest gold chains dangle from the fobs of gamblers and gentlemen of
  very limited means; costly ornaments on <!-- Page 90 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>[90]</span>ladies, indicate to the
  eyes that are well opened, the fact of a silly lover or husband cramped
  for funds.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Plain and Neat.</b>&mdash;When a pretty woman goes by in plain
  and neat apparel, it is the presumption that she has fair expectations,
  and a husband that can show a balance in his favor. For women are like
  books,&mdash;too much gilding makes men suspicious, that the binding is
  the most important part. The body is the shell of the soul, and the dress
  is the husk of the body; but the husk generally tells what the kernel is.
  As a fashionably dressed young lady passed some gentlemen, one of them
  raised his hat, whereupon another, struck by the fine appearance of the
  lady, made some inquiries concerning her, and was answered thus: "She
  makes a pretty ornament in her father's house, but otherwise is of no
  use."</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Richest Dress.</b>&mdash;The richest dress is always worn on
  the soul. The adornments that will not perish, and that all men most
  admire, shine from the heart through this life. God has made it our
  highest, holiest duty, to dress the soul he has given us. It is wicked to
  waste it in frivolity. It is a beautiful, undying, precious thing. If
  every young woman would think of her soul when she looks in the glass,
  would hear the cry of her naked mind when she dallies away her precious
  hours at her toilet, would listen to the sad moaning of her hollow heart,
  as it wails through her idle, useless life, something would be done for
  the elevation of womanhood.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Dressing Up.</b>&mdash;Compare a well-dressed body with a
  well-dressed mind. Compare a taste for dress with a taste for knowledge,
  culture, virtue, and piety. Dress up an ignorant young woman in the
  "height of fashion"; put on plumes and flowers, diamonds and gewgaws;
  paint her face, girt up her waist, and I ask you, if this side of a
  painted and feathered savage you can find anything more unpleasant to
  behold. And yet such young women we meet by the hundred every day on the
  street and in all our public places. It is awful to think of.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Dress Affects our Manners.</b>&mdash;A man who is badly dressed,
  feels chilly, sweaty, and prickly. He stammers, and does not always tell
  the truth. He means to, perhaps, but he can't. He is half distracted
  about his pantaloons, which are much to short, and are constantly
  hitching up; or his frayed jacket and crumpled linen harrow his soul, and
  quite unman him. He treads on the train of a lady's dress, and says,
  "Thank you", sits down on his hat, and wishes the "desert were his
  dwelling place."</p>

  </div>
  <p>1. <b>The Highest Style of Beauty.</b>&mdash;The highest style of
  beauty to be found in nature pertains to the human form, as animated and
  lighted up by the intelligence within. It is the expression of the soul
  that constitutes this superior beauty. It is that which looks out of the
  eye, which sits in calm majesty on the brow, lurks on the lip, smiles on
  the cheek, is set forth in the chiselled lines and features of the
  countenance, in the general contour of figure and form, in the movement,
  and gesture, and tone; it is this looking out of the invisible spirit
  that dwells within, this manifestation of the higher nature, that we
  admire and love; this constitutes to us the beauty of our species. <!--
  Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>[92]</span></p>

  <p>2. <b>Beauty Which Perishes Not.</b>&mdash;There is a beauty which
  perishes not. It is such as the angels wear. It forms the washed white
  robes of the saints. It wreathes the countenance of every doer of good.
  It adorns every honest face. It shines in the virtuous life. It molds the
  hands of charity. It sweetens the voice of sympathy. It sparkles on the
  brow of wisdom. It flashes in the eye of love. It breathes in the spirit
  of piety. It is the beauty of the heaven of heavens. It is that which may
  grow by the hand of culture in every human soul. It is the flower of the
  spirit which blossoms on the tree of life. Every soul may plant and
  nurture it in its own garden, in its own Eden.</p>

  <p>3. <b>We May All Be Beautiful.</b>&mdash;This is the capacity of
  beauty that God has given to the human soul, and this the beauty placed
  within the reach of all. We may all be beautiful. Though our forms may be
  uncomely and our features not the prettiest, our spirits may be
  beautiful. And this inward beauty always shines through. A beautiful
  heart will flash out in the eye. A lovely soul will glow in the face. A
  sweet spirit will tune the voice, wreathe the countenance in charms. Oh,
  there is a power in interior beauty that melts the hardest heart!</p>

  <p>4. <b>Woman the Most Perfect Type of Beauty.</b>&mdash;Woman, by
  common consent, we regard as the most perfect type of beauty on earth. To
  her we ascribe the highest charms belonging to this wonderful element so
  profusely mingled in all God's works. Her form is molded and finished in
  exquisite delicacy of perfection. The earth gives us no form more
  perfect, no features more symmetrical, no style more chaste, no movements
  more graceful, no finish more complete; so that our artists ever have and
  ever will regard the woman-form of humanity as the most perfect earthly
  type of beauty. This form is most perfect and symmetrical in the youth of
  womanhood; so that the youthful woman is earth's queen of beauty. This is
  true, not only by the common consent of mankind, but also by the
  strictest rules of scientific criticism.</p>

    A REJECTED LOVER.
  </div>
  <p>5. <b>Fadeless Beauty.</b>&mdash;There cannot be a picture without its
  bright spots; and the steady contemplation of what is bright in others,
  has a reflex influence upon the beholder. It reproduces what it reflects.
  Nay, it seems to leave an impress even upon the countenance. The feature,
  from having a dark, sinister aspect, becomes open, serene, and sunny. A
  countenance so impressed, has neither the vacant stare of the idiot, nor
  the crafty, penetrating look of the basilisk, but the clear, placid
  aspect of truth and goodness. The woman <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>[94]</span>who has such a face is
  beautiful. She has a beauty which changes not with the features, which
  fades not with years. It is beauty of expression. It is the only kind of
  beauty which can be relied upon for a permanent influence with the other
  sex. The violet will soon cease to smile. Flowers must fade. The love
  that has nothing but beauty to sustain it, soon withers away.</p>

  <p>6. <b>A Pretty Woman Pleases the Eye</b>, a good woman, the heart. The
  one is a jewel, the other a treasure. Invincible fidelity, good humor,
  and complacency of temper, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and
  make the decay of it invisible. That is true beauty which has not only a
  substance, but a spirit; a beauty that we must intimately know to justly
  appreciate.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Woman You Love Best.</b>&mdash;Beauty, dear reader, is
  probably the woman you love best, but we trust it is the beauty of soul
  and character, which sits in calm majesty on the brow, lurks on the lip,
  and will outlive what is called a fine face.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Wearing of Ornaments.</b>&mdash;Beauty needs not the foreign
  aid of ornament, but is when unadorned adorned the most, is a trite
  observation; but with a little qualification it is worthy of general
  acceptance. Aside from the dress itself, ornaments should be very
  sparingly used&mdash;at any rate, the danger lies in over-loading
  oneself, and not in using too few. A young girl, and especially one of a
  light and airy style of beauty, should never wear gems. A simple flower
  in her hair or on her bosom is all that good taste will permit. When
  jewels or other ornaments are worn, they should be placed where you
  desire the eye of the spectator to rest, leaving the parts to which you
  do not want attention called as plain and negative as possible. There is
  no surer sign of vulgarity than a profusion of heavy jewelry carried
  about upon the person.</p>

  <p>1. <span class="sc">For Scrawny Neck</span>.&mdash;Take off your tight
  collars, feather boas and such heating things. Wash neck and chest with
  hot water, then rub in sweet oil all that you can work in. Apply this
  every night before you retire and leave the skin damp with it while you
  sleep.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="sc">For Red Hands</span>.&mdash;Keep your feet warm by
  soaking them often in hot water, and keep your hands out of the water as
  much as possible. Rub your hands with the skin of a lemon and it will
  whiten them. If your skin will bear glycerine after you have washed, pour
  into the palm a little glycerine and lemon juice mixed, and rub over the
  hands and wipe off.</p>

  <p>3. <span class="sc">Neck and Face</span>.&mdash;Do not bathe the neck
  and face just before or after being out of doors. It tends to wrinkle the
  skin.</p>

  <p>4. <span class="sc">Scowls</span>.&mdash;Never allow yourself to
  scowl, even if the sun be in your eyes. That scowl will soon leave its
  trace and no beauty will outlive it. <!-- Page 96 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>[96]</span></p>

  <p>5. <span class="sc">Wrinkled Forehead</span>.&mdash;If you wrinkle
  your forehead when you talk or read, visit an oculist and have your eyes
  tested, and then wear glasses to fit them.</p>

  <p>6. <span class="sc">Old Looks</span>.&mdash;Sometimes your face looks
  old because it is tired. Then apply the following wash and it will make
  you look younger: Put three drops of ammonia, a little borax, a
  tablespoonful of bay rum, and a few drops of camphor into warm water and
  apply to your face. Avoid getting it into your eyes.</p>

  <p>7. <span class="sc">The Best Cosmetic</span>.&mdash;Squeeze the juice
  of a lemon into a pint of sweet milk. Wash the face with it every night
  and in the morning wash off with warm rain water. This will produce a
  very beautiful effect upon the skin.</p>

  <p>8. <span class="sc">Spots on the Face</span>.&mdash;Moles and many
  other discolorations may be removed from the face by a preparation
  composed of one part chemically pure carbolic acid and two parts pure
  glycerine. Touch the spots with a camel's-hair pencil, being careful that
  the preparation does not come in contact with the adjacent skin. Five
  minutes after touching, bathe with soft water and apply a little
  vaseline. It may be necessary to repeat the operation, but if persisted
  in, the blemishes will be entirely removed.</p>

  <p>9. <span class="sc">Wrinkles</span>.&mdash;This prescription is said
  to cure wrinkles: Take one ounce of white wax and melt it to a gentle
  heat. Add two ounces of the juice of lily bulbs, two ounces of honey, two
  drams of rose water, and a drop or two of ottar of roses. Apply twice a
  day, rubbing the wrinkles the wrong way. Always use tepid water for
  washing the face.</p>

  <p>10. <span class="sc">The Hair</span>.&mdash;The hair must be kept free
  from dust or it will fall out. One of the best things for cleaning it, is
  a raw egg rubbed into the roots and then washed out in several waters.
  The egg furnishes material for the hair to grow on, while keeping the
  scalp perfectly clean. Apply once a month.</p>

  <p>11. <span class="sc">Loss of Hair</span>.&mdash;When through sickness
  or headache the hair falls out, the following tonic may be applied with
  good effect: Use one ounce of glycerine, one ounce of bay rum, one pint
  of strong sage tea, and apply every other night, rubbing well into the
  scalp.</p>

<h2>How to Keep the Bloom and Grace of Youth.</h2>

<h3>THE SECRET OF ITS PRESERVATION.</h3>

    MRS. WM. MCKINLEY.
  </div>
  <p>1. The question most often asked by women is regarding the art of
  retaining, with advancing years, the bloom and grace of youth. This
  secret is not learned through the analysis of chemical compounds, but by
  a thorough study of nature's laws peculiar to their sex. It is useless
  for women with wrinkled faces, dimmed eyes and blemished skins to seek
  for external applications of beautifying balms and lotions to bring the
  glow of life and health into the face, and yet there are truths, simple
  yet wonderful, whereby the bloom of early life can be restored and
  retained, as should be the heritage of all God's children, sending the
  light of beauty into every woman's face. The secret:</p>

  <p>2. Do not bathe in hard water; soften it with a few drops of ammonia,
  or a little borax.</p>

  <p>3. Do not bathe the face while it is very warm, and never use very
  cold water.</p>

  <p>4. Do not attempt to remove dust with cold water; give your face a hot
  bath, using plenty of good soap, then give it a thorough rinsing with
  warm water.</p>

  <p>5. Do not rub your face with a coarse towel.</p>

  <p>6. Do not believe you can remove wrinkles by filling in the crevices
  with powder. Give your face a Russian bath every night; that is, bathe it
  with water so hot that you wonder how you can bear it, and then, a minute
  after, with moderately cold water, that will make your face glow with
  warmth; dry it with a soft towel.</p>

<h2>Form and Deformity.</h2>

    MALE. FEMALE.<br /> Showing the Difference in Form and
    Proportion.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Physical Deformities.</b>&mdash;Masquerading is a modern
  accomplishment. Girls wear tight shoes, burdensome skirts, corsets, etc.,
  all of which prove so fatal to their health. At the age of seventeen or
  eighteen, our "young ladies" are sorry specimens of feminality; and
  palpitators, cosmetics and all the modern paraphernalia are required to
  make them appear fresh and blooming. Man is equally at fault. A devotee
  to all the absurd devices of fashion, he practically asserts that "dress
  makes the man." But physical deformities are of far less importance than
  moral imperfections.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Development of the Individual.</b>&mdash;It is not possible for
  human beings to attain their full stature of humanity, except by loving
  long and perfectly. Behold that venerable man! he is mature in judgment,
  perfect in every action and expression, and saintly in goodness. You
  almost worship as you behold. What rendered him thus perfect? What <!--
  Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>[99]</span>rounded
  off his natural asperities, and moulded up his virtues? Love, mainly. It
  permeated every pore, and seasoned every fibre of his being, as could
  nothing else. Mark that matronly woman. In the bosom of her family she is
  more than a queen and goddess combined. All her looks and actions express
  the outflowing of some or all of the human virtues. To know her is to
  love her. She became thus perfect, not in a day or year, but by a long
  series of appropriate means. Then by what? Chiefly in and by love, which
  is specially adapted thus to develop this maturity.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Physical Stature.</b>&mdash;Men and women generally increase in
  stature until the twenty-fifth year, and it is safe to assume, that
  perfection of function is not established until maturity of bodily
  development is completed. The physical contour of these representations
  plainly exhibits the difference in structure, and also implies difference
  of function. Solidity and strength are represented by the organization of
  the male, grace and beauty by that of the female. His broad shoulders
  represent physical power and the right of dominion, while her bosom is
  the symbol of love and nutrition.</p>

<h3>HOW TO DETERMINE A PERFECT HUMAN FIGURE.</h3>

    Lady's Dress in the days of Greece.
  </div>
  <p>The proportions of the perfect human figure are strictly mathematical.
  The whole figure is six times the length of the foot. Whether the form be
  slender or plump, this rule holds good. Any deviation from it is a
  departure from the highest beauty of proportion. The Greeks made all
  their statues according to this rule. The face, from the highest point of
  the forehead, where the hair begins, to the end of the chin, is one-tenth
  of the whole stature. The hand, from the wrist to the end of the middle
  finger, is the same. The chest is a fourth, and from the nipples to the
  top of the head is the same. From the top of the chest to the highest
  point of the forehead is a seventh. If the length of the face, from the
  roots of the hair to the chin, be divided into three equal parts, the
  first division determines the point where the eyebrows meet, and the
  second the place of the nostrils. The navel is the central point of the
  human body, and if a man should lie on his back with his arms and legs
  extended, the periphery of the circle which might be described around
  him, with the navel for its center, would touch the extremities of his
  hands and feet. The height from the feet to the top of the head is the
  same as the <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>[100]</span>distance from the extremity of one hand to
  the extremity of the other when the arms are extended.</p>

  <p>The Venus de Medici is considered the most perfect model of the female
  forms, and has been the admiration of the world for ages. Alexander
  Walker, after minutely describing this celebrated statue, says: "All
  these admirable characteristics of the female form, the mere existence of
  which in woman must, one is temped to imagine, be, even to herself, a
  source of ineffable pleasure, these constitute a being worthy, as the
  personification of beauty, of occupying the temples of Greece; present an
  object finer, alas, than Nature even seems capable of producing; and
  offer to all nations and ages a theme of admiration and delight." Well
  might Thomson say:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>So stands the statue that enchants the world,</p>
      <p>So, bending, tries to vail the matchless boast&mdash;</p>
      <p>The mingled beauties of exulting Greece.</p>

  <p>We beg our readers to observe the form of the waist (evidently
  innocent of corsets and tight dresses) of this model woman, and also that
  of the Greek Slave in the accompanying outlines. These forms are such as
  unperverted nature and the highest art alike require. To compress the
  waist, and thereby change its form, pushing the ribs inward, displacing
  the vital organs, and preventing the due expansion of the lungs, is as
  destructive to beauty as it is to health. <!-- Page 101 --><span

<h3>THE HISTORY, MYSTERY, BENEFITS AND INJURIES
OF THE CORSET.</h3>

  <div class="figright" style="width:15%;">
      <a href="images/gs101.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/102.jpg"
      alt="The Corset in the 18th Century." title="The Corset in the 18th Century." /></a>
    The Corset in the 18th Century.
  </div>
  <p>1. The origin of the corset is lost in remote antiquity. The figures
  of the early Egyptian women show clearly an artificial shape of the waist
  produced by some style of corset. A similar style of dress must also have
  prevailed among the ancient Jewish maidens; for Isaiah, in calling upon
  the women to put away their personal adornments, says: "Instead of a
  girdle there shall be a rent, and instead of a stomacher (corset) a
  girdle of sackcloth."</p>

  <p>2. Homer also tells us of the cestus or girdle of Venus, which was
  borrowed by the haughty Juno with a view to increasing her personal
  attractions, that Jupiter might be a more tractable and orderly
  husband.</p>

  <p>3. Coming down to the later times, we find the corset was used in
  France and England as early as the 12th century.</p>

  <p>4. The most extensive and extreme use of the corset occurred in the
  16th century, during the reign of Catherine de Medici of France and Queen
  Elizabeth of England. With Catherine de Medici a thirteen-inch waist
  measurement was considered the standard of fashion, while a thick waist
  was an abomination. No lady could consider her figure of proper shape
  unless she could span her waist with her two hands. To produce this
  result a strong rigid corset was worn night and day until the waist was
  laced down to the required size. Then over this corset was placed the
  steel apparatus shown in the illustration on next page. This corset-cover
  reached from the hip to the throat, and <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>[102]</span>produced a rigid figure
  over which the dress would fit with perfect smoothness.</p>

  <p>5. During the 18th century corsets were largely made from a species of
  leather known as "Bend," which was not unlike that used for shoe soles,
  and measured nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness. One of the most
  popular corsets of the time was the corset and stomacher shown in the
  accompanying illustration.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:15%;">

      alt="Steel Corset worn in Catherine's time." title="Steel Corset worn in Catherine's time." /></a>
    Steel Corset worn in Catherine's time.
  </div>
  <p>6. About the time of the French Revolution a reaction set in against
  tight lacing, and for a time there was a return to the early classical
  Greek costume. This style of dress prevailed, with various modifications,
  until about 1810, when corsets and tight lacing again returned with
  threefold fury. Buchan, a prominent writer of this period, says that it
  was by no means uncommon to see "a mother lay her daughter down upon the
  carpet, and, placing her foot upon her back, break half a dozen laces in
  tightening her stays."</p>

  <p>7. It is reserved to our own time to demonstrate that corsets and
  tight lacing do not necessarily go hand in hand. Distortion and
  feebleness are not beauty. A proper proportion should exist between the
  size of the waist and the breadth of the shoulders and hips, and if the
  waist is diminished below this proportion, it suggests disproportion and
  invalidism rather than grace and beauty.</p>

  <p>8. The perfect corset is one which possesses just that degree of
  rigidity which will prevent it from wrinkling, but will at the same time
  allow freedom in the bending and twisting of the body. Corsets boned with
  whalebone, horn or steel are necessarily stiff, rigid and uncomfortable.
  After a few days' wear the bones or steels become bent and set in
  position, or, as more frequently happens, they break and cause injury or
  discomfort to the wearer.</p>

  <p>9. About seven years ago an article was discovered for the stiffening
  of corsets, which has revolutionized the corset industry of the world.
  This article is manufactured from <!-- Page 103 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>[103]</span>the natural fibers of
  the Mexican Ixtle plant, and is known as Coraline. It consists of
  straight, stiff fibers like bristles bound together into a cord by being
  wound with two strands of thread passing in opposite directions. This
  produces an elastic fiber intermediate in stiffness between twine and
  whalebone. It cannot break, but it possesses all the stiffness and
  flexibility necessary to hold the corset in shape and prevent its
  wrinkling.</p>

  <p>We congratulate the ladies of to-day upon the advantages they enjoy
  over their sisters of two centuries ago, in the forms and the graceful
  and easy curves of the corsets now made as compared with those of former
  times.</p>

    THE NATURAL WAIST.<br /> THE EFFECTS OF
    LACING.
  </div>
  <p>It destroys natural beauty and creates an unpleasant and irritable
  temper. A tight-laced chest and a good disposition cannot go together.
  The human form has been molded by nature, the best shape is undoubtedly
  that which she has given it. To endeavor to render it more elegant by
  artificial means is to change it; to make it much smaller below and much
  larger above is to destroy its beauty; to keep it cased up in a kind of
  domestic cuirass is not only to deform it, but to expose the internal
  parts to serious injury. Under such compression as is commonly practiced
  by ladies, the <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>[105]</span>development of the bones, which are still
  tender, does not take place conformably to the intention of nature,
  because nutrition is necessarily stopped, and they consequently become
  twisted and deformed.</p>

  <p>Those who wear these appliances of tight-lacing often complain that
  they cannot sit upright without them&mdash;are sometimes, indeed,
  compelled to wear them during all the twenty-four hours; a fact which
  proves to what extent such articles weaken the muscles of the trunk. The
  injury does not fall merely on the internal structure of the body, but
  also on its beauty, and on the temper and feelings with which that beauty
  is associated. Beauty is in reality but another name for expression of
  countenance, which is the index of sound health, intelligence, good
  feelings and peace of mind. All are aware that uneasy feelings, existing
  habitually in the breast speedily exhibit their signature on the
  countenance, and that bitter thoughts or a bad temper spoil the human
  expression of its comeliness and grace.</p>

<h2>The Care of the Hair.</h2>

    NATURAL HAIR.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>The Color of the Hair.</b>&mdash;The color of the hair
  corresponds with that of the skin&mdash;being dark or black, with a dark
  complexion, and red or yellow with a fair skin. When a white skin is seen
  in conjunction with black hair, as among the women of Syria and Barbary,
  the apparent exception arises from protection from the sun's rays, and
  opposite colors are often found among people of one prevailing feature.
  Thus red-haired Jews are not uncommon, though the nation in general have
  dark complexion and hair.</p>

  <p>2. <b>The Imperishable Nature of Hair.</b>&mdash;The imperishable
  nature of hair arises from the combination of salt and metals in its
  composition. In old tombs and on mummies it has been found in a perfect
  state, after a lapse of over two thousand years. There are many curious
  accounts proving the indestructibility of the human hair.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Tubular.</b>&mdash;In the human family the hairs are tubular,
  the tubes being intersected by partitions, resembling in some degree the
  cellular tissue of plants. Their hollowness prevents incumbrance from
  weight, while their power of resistance is increased by having their
  traverse sections rounded in form.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Cautions.</b>&mdash;It is ascertained that a full head of hair,
  beard and whiskers, are a prevention against colds and consumptions.
  Occasionally, however, it is found necessary to remove the hair from the
  head, in cases of fever or disease, to stay the inflammatory symptoms,
  and to relieve the brain. The head should invariably be kept cool. Close
  night-caps are unhealthy, and smoking-caps and coverings for the head
  within doors are alike detrimental to the free growth of the hair,
  weakening it, and causing it to fall out.</p>

<h3>HOW TO BEAUTIFY AND PRESERVE THE HAIR.</h3>

  <p>1. <b>To Beautify the Hair.</b>&mdash;Keep the head clean, the pores
  of the skin open, and the whole circulatory system in a healthy
  condition, and you will have no need of bear's grease (alias hog's lard).
  Where there is a tendency in the hair to fall off on account of the
  weakness or sluggishness of the circulation, or an unhealthy state of the
  skin, cold water and friction with a tolerably stiff brush are probably
  the best remedial agents.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Barber's Shampoos.</b>&mdash;Are very beneficial if properly
  prepared. They should not be made too strong. Avoid strong shampoos of
  any kind. Great caution should be exercised in this matter. <!-- Page 108
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>[108]</span></p>

  <p>3. <b>Care of the Hair.</b>&mdash;To keep the hair healthy, keep the
  head clean. Brush the scalp well with a stiff brush, while dry. Then wash
  with castile soap, and rub into the roots, bay rum, brandy or camphor
  water. This done twice a month will prove beneficial. Brush the scalp
  thoroughly twice a week. Dampen the hair with soft water at the toilet,
  and do not use oil.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Hair Wash.</b>&mdash;Take one ounce of borax, half an ounce of
  camphor powder&mdash;these ingredients fine&mdash;and dissolve them in
  one quart of boiling water. When cool, the solution will be ready for
  use. Dampen the hair frequently. This wash is said not only to cleanse
  and beautify, but to strengthen the hair, preserve the color and prevent
  baldness.</p>

  <p><b>Another Excellent Wash.</b>&mdash;The best wash we know for
  cleansing and softening the hair is an egg beaten up and rubbed well into
  the hair, and afterwards washed out with several washes of warm
  water.</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Only Sensible and Safe Hair Oil.</b>&mdash;The following is
  considered a most valuable preparation: Take of extract of yellow
  Peruvian bark, fifteen grains; extract of rhatany root, eight grains;
  extract of burdoch root and oil of nutmegs (fixed), of each two drachms;
  camphor (dissolve with spirits of wine), fifteen grains; beef marrow, two
  ounces; best olive oil, one ounce; citron juice, half a drachm; aromatic
  essential oil, as much as sufficient to render it fragrant; mix and make
  into an ointment. Two drachms of bergamot, and a few drops of attar of
  roses would suffice.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Hair Wash.</b>&mdash;A good hair wash is soap and water, and the
  oftener it is applied the freer the surface of the head will be from
  scurf. The hair-brush should also be kept in requisition morning and
  evening.</p>

  <p>7. <b>To Remove Superfluous Hair.</b>&mdash;With those who dislike the
  use of arsenic, the following is used for removing superfluous hair from
  the skin: Lime, one ounce; carbonate of potash, two ounces; charcoal
  powder, one drachm. For use, make it into a paste with a little warm
  water, and apply it to the part, previously shaved close. As soon as it
  has become thoroughly dry, it may be washed off with a little warm
  water.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Coloring for Eyelashes and Eyebrows.</b>&mdash;In eyelashes the
  chief element of beauty consists in their being long and glossy; the
  eyebrows should be finely arched and clearly divided from each other. The
  most innocent darkener of the brow is the expressed juice of the
  elderberry, or a burnt clove. <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a

      alt="Discussing the fashions." title="Discussing the fashions." /></a>
    DISCUSSING THE FASHIONS.
  </div>
  <p>9. <b>Crimping Hair.</b>&mdash;To make the hair stay in crimps, take
  five cents worth of gum arabic and add to it just enough boiling water to
  dissolve it. When dissolved, add enough alcohol to make it rather thin.
  Let this stand all night and then bottle it to prevent the alcohol from
  evaporating. This put on the hair at night, after it is done up in papers
  or pins, will make it stay in crimp the hottest day, and is perfectly
  harmless.</p>

  <p>10. <b>To Curl the Hair.</b>&mdash;There is no preparation that will
  make naturally straight hair assume a permanent curl. The following will
  keep the hair in curl for a short time: Take borax, two ounces; gum
  arabic, one drachm; and hot <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>[110]</span>water, not boiling, one quart; stir, and,
  as soon as the ingredients are dissolved, add three tablespoonfuls of
  strong spirits of camphor. On retiring to rest, wet the hair with the
  above liquid, and roll in twists of paper as usual. Do not disturb the
  hair until morning, when untwist and form into ringlets.</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Alcohol, a half pint.</p>
      <p>Salt, as much as will dissolve.</p>
      <p>Glycerine, a tablespoonful.</p>
      <p>Flour of sulphur, teaspoonful. Mix.</p>
    </div>

  <p>12. <b>To Darken the Hair without Bad Effects.</b>&mdash;Take:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Blue vitriol (powdered), one drachm.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Gray Hair.</b>&mdash;There are no known means by which the hair
  can be prevented from turning gray, and none which can restore it to its
  original hue, except through the process of dyeing. The numerous "hair
  color restorers" which are advertised are chemical preparations which act
  in the manner of a dye or as a paint, and are nearly always dependent for
  their power on the presence of lead. This mineral, applied to the skin,
  for a long time, will lead to the most disastrous
  maladies&mdash;lead-palsy, lead colic, and other symptoms of poisoning.
  It should, therefore, never be used for this purpose.</p>

<h2>How to Cure Pimples or Other
Facial Eruptions.</h2>

  </div>
  <p>1. It requires self-denial to get rid of pimples, for persons troubled
  with them will persist in eating fat meats and other articles of food
  calculated to produce them. Avoid the use of rich gravies, or pastry, or
  anything of the kind in excess. Take all the out-door exercise yon can
  and never indulge in a late supper. Retire at a reasonable hour, and rise
  early in the morning. Sulphur to purify the blood may be taken three
  times a week&mdash;a thimbleful in a glass of milk before breakfast. It
  takes some time for the sulphur to do its work, therefore persevere in
  its use till the humors, or pimples, or blotches, disappear. Avoid
  getting wet while taking the sulphur.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Try This Recipe</b>: Wash the face twice a day in warm water,
  and rub dry with a coarse towel. Then with a soft towel rub in a lotion
  made of two ounces of white brandy, one ounce of cologne, and one-half
  ounce of liquor potassa. <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>[112]</span>Persons subject to skin eruptions should
  avoid very salty or fat food. A dose of Epsom salts occasionally might
  prove beneficial.</p>

  <p>3. Wash the face in a dilution of carbolic acid, allowing one
  teaspoonful to a pint of water. This is an excellent and purifying
  lotion, and may be used on the most delicate skins. Be careful about
  letting this wash get into the eyes.</p>

  <p>4. Oil of sweet almonds, one ounce; fluid potash, one drachm. Shake
  well together, and then add rose water, one ounce; pure water, six
  ounces. Mix. Rub the pimples or blotches for some minutes with a rough
  towel, and then dab them with the lotion.</p>

  <p>5. Dissolve one ounce of borax, and sponge the face with it every
  night. When there are insects, rub on flower of sulphur dry after
  washing, rub well and wipe dry; use plenty of castile soap.</p>

  <p>6. Dilute corrosive sublimate with oil of almonds. A few days'
  application will remove them.</p>

    A HEALTHY COMPLEXION.
  </div>
  <p>This is a minute little creature, scientifically called <i>Demodex
  folliculorum</i>, hardly visible to the naked eye, with comparatively
  large fore body, a more slender hind body and eight little stumpy
  processes that do duty as legs. No specialized head is visible, although
  of course there is a mouth orifice. These creatures live on the sweat
  glands or pores of the human face, and owing to the appearance that they
  give to the infested pores, they are usually known as "black-heads." It
  is not at all uncommon to see an otherwise pretty face disfigured by
  these ugly creatures, although the insects themselves are nearly
  transparent white. The black appearance is really due the accumulation of
  dirt which gets under the edges of the skin of the enlarged sweat glands
  and cannot be removed in the ordinary way by washing, because the
  abnormal, hardened secretion of the gland itself becomes stained. These
  insects are so lowly organized that it is almost impossible to
  satisfactorily deal with them. <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>[113]</span>and they sometimes cause the continual
  festering of the skin which they inhabit.</p>

  <p><b>Remedy.</b>&mdash;Press them out with a hollow key or with the
  thumb and fingers, and apply a mixture of sulphur and cream every
  evening. Wash every morning with the best toilet soap, or wash the face
  with hot water with a soft flannel at bedtime.</p>

      alt="Love's young dream." title="Love's young dream." /></a>
    LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Love Blends Young Hearts.</b>&mdash;Love blends young hearts in
  blissful unity, and, for the time, so ignores past ties and affections,
  as to make willing separation of the son from his father's house, and the
  daughter from all the sweet endearments of her childhood's home, to go
  out together, and rear for themselves an altar, around which shall
  cluster all the cares and delights, the anxieties and sympathies, of the
  family relationship; this love, if pure, unselfish, and discreet,
  constitutes the chief usefulness and happiness of human life.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Without Love.</b>&mdash;Without love there would be no organized
  households, and, consequently, none of that earnest endeavor for
  competence and respectability, which is the mainspring to human effort;
  none of those sweet, softening, restraining and elevating influences of
  domestic life, which can alone fill the earth with the glory of the Lord
  and make glad the city of Zion. This love is indeed heaven upon earth;
  but above would not be heaven without it; where there is not love, there
  is fear; but, "love casteth out fear." And yet we naturally do offend
  what we most love.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Love Is the Sun of Life.</b>&mdash;Most beautiful in morning and
  evening, but warmest and steadiest at noon. It is the sun of the soul.
  Life without love is worse than death; a world without a sun. The love
  which does not lead to labor will soon die out, and the thankfulness
  which does not embody itself in sacrifices is already changing to
  gratitude. Love is not ripened in one day, nor in many, nor even in a
  human lifetime. It is the oneness of soul with soul in appreciation and
  perfect trust. To be blessed it must rest in that faith in the Divine
  which underlies every other motion. To be true, it must be eternal as God
  himself.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Love Is Dependent.</b>&mdash;Remember that love is dependent
  upon forms; courtesy of etiquette guards and protects courtesy of heart.
  How many hearts have been lost irrevocably, and how many averted eyes and
  cold looks have been gained from what seemed, perhaps, but a trifling
  negligence of forms?</p>

    LOVE MAKING IN THE EARLY COLONIAL DAYS.
  </div>
  <p>5. <b>Radical Differences.</b>&mdash;Men and women should not be
  judged by the same rules. There are many radical differences in their
  affectional natures. Man is the creature of interest and ambition. His
  nature leads him forth into the struggle and bustle of the world. Love is
  but the embellishment of his early life, or a song piped in the intervals
  of the acts. He seeks for fame, for fortune, for space in the world's
  thoughts, and dominion over his fellow-men. But a woman's whole life is a
  history of the affections. The heart is her world; it is there her
  ambition strives for empire; it is there her ambition seeks for hidden
  treasures. She sends forth her sympathies on adventure; she embarks her
  whole soul in the traffic of affection; and if shipwrecked her case is
  hopeless, for it is bankruptcy of the heart.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Woman's Love.</b>&mdash;Woman's love is stronger than death; it
  rises superior to adversity, and towers in sublime beauty above the
  niggardly selfishness of the world. Misfortune cannot suppress it; enmity
  cannot alienate it; temptation cannot enslave it. It is the guardian
  angel of the nursery and the sick bed; it gives an affectionate concord
  to the partnership of life and interest, circumstances cannot modify it;
  it ever remains the same to sweeten existence, to purify the cup of life,
  on the rugged pathway to the grave, and melt to moral pliability the
  brittle nature of man. It is the ministering spirit of home, hovering in
  soothing caresses over the cradle, and the death-bed of the household,
  and filling up the urn of all its sacred memories.</p>

  <p>7. <b>A Lady's Complexion.</b>&mdash;He who loves a lady's complexion,
  form and features, loves not her true self, but her soul's old clothes.
  The love that has nothing but beauty to sustain it, soon withers and
  dies. The love that is fed with presents always requires feeding. Love,
  and love only, is the loan for love. Love is of the nature of a burning
  glass, which, kept still in one place, fireth; changed often, it doth
  nothing. The purest joy we can experience in one we love, is to see that
  person a source of happiness to others. When you are with the person
  loved, you have no sense of being bored. This humble and trivial
  circumstance is the great test&mdash;the only sure and abiding test of
  love.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Two Souls Come Together.</b>&mdash;When two souls come together,
  each seeking to magnify the other, each in subordinate sense worshiping
  the other, each help the other; the two flying together so that each
  wing-beat of the one helps each wing-beat of the other&mdash;when two
  souls come together thus, they are lovers. They who unitedly move
  themselves away from grossness and from earth, toward the throne of
  crystaline and the pavement golden, are, indeed, true lovers.</p>

<h2>The Power and Peculiarities of Love.</h2>

<hr class="short" >

<h3>LOVE IS A TONIC AND A REMEDY FOR DISEASE,
MAKES PEOPLE LOOK YOUNGER,
CREATES INDUSTRY, ETC.</h3>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"All thoughts, all passions, all desires,</p>
      <p class="i2">Whatever stirs this mortal frame,</p>

      <p class="i2">And feed his sacred flame."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>1. It is a physological fact long demonstrated that persons possessing
  a loving disposition borrow less of the cares of life, and also live much
  longer than persons with a strong, narrow and selfish nature. Persons who
  love scenery, love domestic animals, show great attachment for all
  friends; love their home dearly and find interest and enchantment in
  almost everything have qualities of mind and heart which indicate good
  health and a happy disposition.</p>

  <p>2. Persons who love music and are constantly humming or whistling a
  tune, are persons that need not be feared, they are kind-hearted and with
  few exceptions possess a loving disposition. Very few good musicians
  become criminals.</p>

  <p>3. Parents that cultivate a love among then children will find that
  the same feeling will soon be manifested in their children's disposition.
  Sunshine in the hearts of the parents will blossom in the lives of the
  children. The parent who continually cherishes a feeling of dislike and
  rebellion in his soul, cultivating moral hatred against his fellow-man,
  will soon find the same things manifested by his son. As the son
  resembles his father in looks so he will to a certain extent resemble him
  in character. Love in the heart of the parent will beget kindness and
  affection in the heart of a child. Continuous scolding and fretting in
  the home will soon make love a stranger. <!-- Page 119 --><span

      alt="The Turkish way of making love." title="The Turkish way of making love." /></a>
    THE TURKISH WAY OF MAKING LOVE
  </div>
  <p>4. If you desire to cultivate love, create harmony in all your
  feelings and faculties. Remember that all that is pure, holy and virtuous
  in love flows from the deepest fountain of the human soul. Poison the
  fountain and you change virtue to vice, and happiness to misery.</p>

  <p>5. Love strengthens health, and disappointment cultivates disease. A
  person in love will invariably enjoy the best of health. Ninety-nine per
  cent. of our strong constitutioned men, now in physical ruin, have
  wrecked themselves on the breakers of an unnatural love. Nothing but
  right love and a right marriage will restore them to health.</p>

  <p>6. All men feel much better for going a courting, providing they court
  purely. Nothing tears the life out of man more than lust, vulgar thoughts
  and immoral conduct. The libertine or harlot has changed love, God's
  purest gift to man, into lust. They cannot acquire love in its purity
  again, the sacred flame has vanished forever. Love is pure, and cannot be
  found in the heart of a seducer.</p>

  <p>7. A woman is never so bright and full of health as when deeply in
  love. Many sickly and frail women are snatched from the clutches of some
  deadly disease and restored to health by falling in love.</p>

  <p>8. It is a long established fact that married persons are healthier
  than unmarried persons; thus it proves that health and happiness belong
  to the home. Health depends upon mind. Love places the mind into a
  delightful state and quickens every human function, makes the blood
  circulate and weaves threads of joy into cables of domestic love.</p>

    PREPARING TO ENTERTAIN HER LOVER.
  </div>
  <p>9. An old but true proverb: "A true man loving one woman will speak
  well of all women. A true woman loving one man will speak well of all
  men. A good wife praises all men, but praises her husband most. A good
  man praises all women, but praises his wife most."</p>

  <p>10. Persons deeply in love become peculiarly pleasant, winning and
  tender. It is said that a musician can never excel or an artist do his
  best until he has been deeply in love. A good orator, a great statesman
  or great men in general are greater and better for having once been
  thoroughly in love. A man who truly loves his wife and home is always a
  safe man to trust.</p>

  <p>11. Love makes people look younger in years. People in unhappy homes
  look older and more worn and fatigued. A woman at thirty, well courted
  and well married, looks five or ten years younger than a woman of the
  same age unhappily married. Old maids and bachelors always look older
  <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>[120]</span>than they are. A flirting widow always
  looks younger than an old maid of like age.</p>

  <p>12. Love renders women industrious and frugal, and a loving husband
  spends lavishly on a loved wife and children, though miserly towards
  others.</p>

  <p>13. Love cultivates self-respect and produces beauty. Beauty in walk
  and beauty in looks; a girl in love is at her best; it brings out the
  finest traits of her character, she walks more erect and is more generous
  and forgiving; her voice is sweeter and she makes happy all about her.
  She works better, sings better and is better.</p>

  <p>14. Now in conclusion, a love marriage is the best life insurance
  policy; it pays dividends every day, while every other insurance policy
  merely promises to pay after death. Remember that statistics demonstrate
  that married people outlive old maids and old bachelors by a goodly
  number of years and enjoy healthier and happier lives.</p>

<h2>Amativeness or Connubial Love.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs123.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/123.jpg"
      alt="Confidence." title="Confidence." /></a>
    CONFIDENCE.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Multiplying the Race.</b>&mdash;Some means for multiplying our
  race is necessary to prevent its extinction by death. Propagation and
  death appertain to man's earthly existence. If the Deity had seen fit to
  bring every member of the human family into being by a direct act of
  creative power, without the agency of parents, the present wise and
  benevolent arrangements of husbands and wives, parents and children,
  friends and neighbors, would have been superseded, and all opportunities
  for exercising parental and connubial love, in which so much enjoyment is
  taken, cut off. But the domestic feelings and relations, as now arranged,
  must strike every philosophical observer as inimitably beautiful and
  perfect&mdash;as the offspring of infinite Wisdom and Goodness
  combined.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Amativeness and its Combinations</b> constitute their origin,
  counterpart, and main medium of manifestation. Its primary function is
  connubial love. From it, mainly, spring those feelings which exist
  between the sexes as such and <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>[123]</span>result in marriage and offspring. Combined
  with the higher sentiments, it gives rise to all those reciprocal kind
  feelings and nameless courtesies which each sex manifests towards the
  other; refining and elevating both, promoting gentility and politeness,
  and greatly increasing social and general happiness.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Renders Men More Polite to Women.</b>&mdash;So far from being in
  the least gross or indelicate, its proper exercise is pure, chaste,
  virtuous, and even an ingredient in good manners. It is this which
  renders men always more polite towards women than to one another, and
  more refined in their society, and which makes women more kind, grateful,
  genteel and tender towards men than women. It makes mothers love their
  sons more than their daughters, and fathers more attached to their
  daughters. Man's endearing recollections of his mother or wife form his
  most powerful incentives to virtue, study, and good deeds, as well as
  restraints upon his vicious inclinations; and, in proportion as a young
  man is dutiful and affectionate to his mother, will he be fond of his
  wife; for, this faculty is the parent of both.</p>

  <p>4. <b>All Should Cultivate the Faculty of Amativeness or Connubial
  Lore.</b>&mdash;Study the personal charms and mental accomplishments of
  the other sex by ardent admirers of beautiful forms, and study graceful
  movements and elegant manners, and remember, much depends upon the tones
  and accents of the voice. Never be gruff if you desire to be winning.
  Seek and enjoy and reciprocate fond looks and feelings. Before you can
  create favorable impressions you must first be honest and sincere and
  natural, and your conquest will be sure and certain.</p>

<hr class="short" >

<h2>Love and Common-Sense.</h2>

  <p>1. Do you love her because she goes to the altar with her head full of
  book learning, her hands of no earthly use, save for the piano and brush;
  because she has no conception of the duties and responsibilities of a
  wife; because she hates housework, hates its everlasting routine and ever
  recurring duties; because she hates children and will adopt every means
  to evade motherhood; because she loves her ease, loves to have her will
  supreme, loves, oh how well, to be free to go and come, to let the days
  slip idly by, to be absolved from all responsibility, to live without
  labor, without care? Will you love her selfish, shirking, calculating
  nature after twenty years of close companionship?</p>

  <p>2. Do you love him because he is a man, and therefore, no matter how
  weak mentally, morally or physically he may <!-- Page 124 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>[124]</span>be, he has vested in
  him the power to save you from the ignominy of an old maid's existence?
  Because you would rather be Mrs. Nobody, than make the effort to be Miss
  Somebody? because you have a great empty place in your head and heart
  that nothing but a man can fill? because you feel you cannot live without
  him? God grant the time may never come when you cannot live with him.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs126.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/126.jpg"
      alt="An earnest caller." title="An earnest caller." /></a>
    AN EARNEST CALLER.
  </div>
  <p>3. Do you love her because she is a thoroughly womanly woman; for her
  tender sympathetic nature; for the jewels of her life, which are absolute
  purity of mind and heart; for the sweet sincerity of her disposition; for
  her loving, charitable thought; for her strength of character? because
  she is pitiful to the sinful, tender to the sorrowful, capable,
  self-reliant, modest, true-hearted? in brief, because she is the
  embodiment of all womanly virtues?</p>

  <p>4. Do you love him because he is a manly man; because the living and
  operating principle of his life is a tender reverence for all women;
  because his love is the overflow of the best part of his nature; because
  he has never soiled his soul with an unholy act or his lips with an oath;
  because mentally he is a man among men; because physically he stands head
  and shoulders above the masses; because morally he is far beyond
  suspicion, in his thought, word or deed; because his earnest manly
  consecrated life is a mighty power on God's side?</p>

  <p>5. But there always has been and always will be unhappy marriages
  until men learn what husbandhood means; how to care for that tenderly
  matured, delicately constituted being, that he takes into his care and
  keeping. That if her wonderful adjusted organism is overtaxed and
  overburdened, her happiness, which is largely dependent upon her health,
  is destroyed.</p>

  <p>6. Until men give the women they marry the undivided love of their
  heart; until constancy is the key-note of a life which speaks eloquently
  of clean thoughts and clean hearts.</p>

  <p>7. Until men and women recognize that self-control in a man, and
  modesty in a woman, will bring a mutual respect that years of wedded life
  will only strengthen. Until they recognize that love is the purest and
  holiest of all things known to humanity, will marriage continue to bring
  unhappiness and discontent, instead of that comfort and restful peace
  which all loyal souls have a right to expect and enjoy.</p>

  <p>8. Be sensible and marry a sensible, honest and industrious companion,
  and happiness through life will be your reward.</p>

  </div>
<h2>What Women Love in Men.</h2>

  <p><b>1.</b> Women naturally love courage, force and firmness in men. The
  ideal man in a woman's eye must be heroic and brave. Woman naturally
  despises a coward, and she has little or no respect for a bashful
  man.</p>

  <p><b>2.</b> Woman naturally loves her lord and master. Women who
  desperately object to be overruled, nevertheless admire men who overrule
  them, and few women would have any respect for a man whom they could
  completely rule and control.</p>

  <p><b>3.</b> Man is naturally the protector of woman; as the male wild
  animal of the forest protects the female, so it is natural for man to
  protect his wife and children, and therefore woman admires those
  qualities in a man which make him a protector.</p>

  <p><b>4. Large Men.</b>&mdash;Women naturally love men of strength, size
  and fine physique, a tall, large and strong man rather than a short,
  small and weak man. A woman always pities a weakly man, but rarely ever
  has any love for him.</p>

  <p><b>5. Small and Weakly Men.</b>&mdash;All men would be of good size in
  frame and flesh, were it not for the infirmities visited upon them by the
  indiscretion of parents and ancestors of generations before.</p>

  <p><b>6. Youthful Sexual Excitement.</b>&mdash;There are many children
  born healthy and vigorous who destroy the full vigor of their generative
  organs in youth by self-abuse, and if they survive and marry, their
  children will have small bones, small frames and sickly constitutions. It
  is therefore not strange that instinct should lead women to admire men
  not touched with these symptoms of physical debility.</p>

  <p><b>7. Generosity.</b>&mdash;Woman generally loves a generous man.
  Religion absorbs a great amount of money in temples, churches,
  ministerial salaries, etc., and ambition and appetite absorb countless
  millions, yet woman receives more gifts from man than all these combined:
  she <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page127"></a>[127]</span>loves a generous giver. <i>Generosity and
  Gallantry</i> are the jewels which she most admires. A woman receiving
  presents from a man implies that she will pay him back in love, and the
  woman who accepts a man's presents, and does not respect him, commits a
  wrong which is rarely ever forgiven.</p>

  <p><b>8. Intelligence.</b>&mdash;Above all other qualities in man, woman
  admires his intelligence. Intelligence is man's woman-captivating card.
  This character in woman is illustrated by an English army officer, as
  told by O. S. Fowler, betrothed in marriage to a beautiful, loving
  heiress, summoned to India, who wrote back to her:</p>

  <p>"I have lost an eye, a leg, an arm, and been so badly marred and
  begrimmed besides, that you never could love this poor, maimed soldier.
  Yet, I love you too well to make your life wretched by requiring you to
  keep your marriage-vow with me, from which I hereby release you. Find
  among English peers one physically more perfect, whom you can love
  better."</p>

  <p>She answered, as all genuine women must answer:</p>

  <p>"Your noble mind, your splendid talents, your martial prowess which
  maimed you, are what I love. As long as you retain sufficient body to
  contain the casket of your soul, which alone is what I admire, I love you
  all the same, and long to make you mine forever."</p>

  <p><b>9. Soft Men.</b>&mdash;All women despise soft and silly men more
  than all other defects in their character. Woman never can love a man
  whose conversation is flat and insipid. Every man seeking woman's
  appreciation or love should always endeavor to show his intelligence and
  manifest an interest in books and daily papers. He should read books and
  inform himself so that he can talk intelligently upon the various topics
  of the day. Even an ignorant woman always loves superior
  intelligence.</p>

  <p><b>10. Sexual Vigor.</b>&mdash;Women love sexual vigor in men. This is
  human nature. Weakly and delicate fathers have weak and puny children,
  though the mother may be strong and robust. A weak mother often bears
  strong children, if the father is physically and sexually vigorous.
  Consumption is often inherited from fathers, because they furnish the
  body, yet more women die with it because of female obstructions. Hence
  women love passion in men, because it endows their offspring with strong
  functional vigor.</p>

  <p><b>11. Passionate Men.</b>&mdash;The less passion any woman possesses,
  the more she prizes a strong passionate man. This is a natural
  consequence, for if she married one equally <!-- Page 128 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>[128]</span>passionless, their
  children would be poorly endowed or they would have none; she therefore
  admires him who makes up the deficiency. Hence very amorous men prefer
  quiet, modest and reserved women.</p>

  <p><b>12. Homely Men</b> are admired by women if they are large, strong
  and vigorous and possess a good degree of intelligence. Looks are trifles
  compared with the other qualities which man may possess.</p>

  <p><b>13. Young Man,</b> If you desire to win the love and <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `admiraton'">admiration</span> of
  young ladies, first, be intelligent; read books and papers; remember what
  you read, so you can talk about it. Second, be generous and do not show a
  stingy and penurious disposition when in the company of ladies. Third, be
  sensible, original, and have opinions of your own and do not agree with
  everything that someone else says, or agree with everything that a lady
  may say. Ladies naturally admire genteel and intelligent discussions and
  conversations when there is someone to talk with who has an opinion of
  his own. Woman despises a man who has no opinion of his own; she hates a
  trifling disposition and admires leadership, original ideas, and looks up
  to man as a leader. Women despise all men whom they can manage, overrule,
  cow-down and subdue.</p>

  <p><b>14. Be Self-Supporting.</b>&mdash;The young man who gives evidence
  of thrift is always in demand. Be enthusiastic and drive with success all
  that you undertake. A young man, sober, honest and industrious, holding a
  responsible position or having a business of his own, is a prize that
  some bright and beautiful young lady would like to draw. Woman admires a
  certainty.</p>

  <p><b>15. Uniformed Men.</b>&mdash;It is a well known fact that women
  love uniformed men. The soldier figures as a hero in about every tale of
  fiction and it is said by good authority that a man in uniform has three
  more chances to marry than the man without uniform. The correct reason
  is, the soldier's profession is bravery, and he is dressed and trained
  for that purpose, and it is that which makes him admired by ladies rather
  than the uniform which he wears. His profession is also that of a
  protector.</p>

<h2>What Men Love in Women.</h2>

  <p><b>1. Female Beauty.</b>&mdash;Men love beautiful women, for woman's
  beauty is the highest type of all beauty. A handsome woman needs no
  diamonds, no silks or satins; her brilliant face outshines diamonds and
  her form is beautiful in calico.</p>

  <p><b>2. False Beautifiers.</b>&mdash;Man's love of female beauty
  surpasses all other love, and whatever artificial means are used to
  beautify, to a certain extent are falsehoods which lead to distrust or
  dislike. Artificial beauty is always an imitation, and never can come
  into competition with the genuine. No art can successfully imitate
  nature.</p>

  <p><b>3. True Kind of Beauty.</b>&mdash;Facial beauty is only skin-deep.
  A beautiful form, a graceful figure, graceful movements and a kind heart
  are the strongest charms in the perfection of female beauty. A brilliant
  face always outshines what may be called a pretty face, for intelligence
  is that queenly grace which crowns woman's influence over men. Good looks
  and good and pure conduct awaken a man's love for women. A girl must
  therefore be charming as well <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>[130]</span>as beautiful, for a charming girl will
  never become a charmless wife.</p>

  <p><b>4. A Good Female Body.</b>&mdash;No weakly, poor-bodied woman can
  draw a man's love like a strong, well developed body. A round, plump
  figure with an overflow of animal life is the woman most commonly sought,
  for nature in man craves for the strong qualities in women, as the health
  and life of offspring depend upon the physical qualities of wife and
  mother. A good body and vigorous health, therefore, become indispensable
  to female beauty.</p>

  <p><b>5. Broad Hips.</b>&mdash;A woman with a large pelvis gives her a
  superior and significant appearance, while a narrow pelvis always
  indicate weak sexuality. The other portions of the body however must be
  in harmony with the size and breadth of the hips.</p>

  <p><b>6. Full Busts.</b>&mdash;In the female beauty of physical
  development there is nothing that can equal full breasts. It is an
  indication of good health and good maternal qualities. As a face looks
  bad without a nose, so the female breast, when narrow and flat, produces
  a bad effect. The female breasts are the means on which a new-born child
  depends for its life and growth, hence it is an essential human instinct
  for men to admire those physical proportions in women which indicate
  perfect motherhood. Cotton and all other false forms simply show the
  value of natural ones. All false forms are easily detected, because large
  natural ones will generally quiver and move at every step, while the
  artificial ones will manifest no expression of life. As woman looks so
  much better with artificial paddings and puffings than she does without,
  therefore modern society should waive all objections to their use. A full
  breast has been man's admiration through all climes and ages, and whether
  this breast-loving instinct is right or wrong, sensible or sensual, it is
  a fact well known to all, that it is a great disappointment to a husband
  and father to see his child brought up on a bottle. Men love full
  breasts, because it promotes maternity. If, however, the breasts are
  abnormally large, it indicates maternal deficiency the same as any
  disproportion or extreme.</p>

  <p><b>7. Small Feet.</b>&mdash;Small feet and small ankles are very
  attractive, because they are in harmony with a perfect female form, and
  men admire perfection. Small feet and ankles indicate modesty and
  reserve, while large feet and ankles indicate coarseness, physical power,
  authority, predominance. Feet and ankles however must be in harmony with
  the body, as small feet and small ankles on a large woman would be out of
  proportion and consequently not beautiful. <!-- Page 131 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>[131]</span></p>

  <p><b>8. Beautiful Arms.</b>&mdash;As the arm is always in proportion
  with the other portions of the body, consequently a well-shaped arm,
  small hands and small wrists, with full muscular development, is a charm
  and beauty not inferior to the face itself, and those who have
  well-shaped arms may be proud of them, because they generally keep
  company with a fine bust and a fine figure.</p>

  <p><b>9. Intelligence.</b>&mdash;A mother must naturally possess
  intelligence, in order to rear her children intelligently, consequently
  it is natural for man to chiefly admire mental qualities in women, for
  utility and practicability depend upon intelligence. Therefore a man
  generally loves those charms in women which prepare her for the duties of
  companionship. If a woman desires to be loved, she must cultivate her
  intellectual gifts, be interesting and entertaining in society, and
  practical and helpful in the home, for these are some of the
  qualifications which make up the highest type of beauty.</p>

  <p><b>10. Piety and Religion in Women.</b>&mdash;Men who love home and
  the companionship of their wives, love truth, honor and honesty. It is
  this higher moral development that naturally leads them to admire women
  of moral and religious natures. It is therefore not strange that immoral
  men love moral and church-loving wives. Man naturally admires the
  qualities which tend to the correct government of the home. Men want good
  and pure children, and it is natural to select women who insure domestic
  contentment and happiness. A bad man, of course, does not deserve a good
  wife, yet he will do his utmost to get one.</p>

  <p><b>11. False Appearance.</b>&mdash;Men love reserved, coy and discreet
  women much more than blunt, shrewd and boisterous. Falsehood, false hair,
  false curls, false forms, false bosoms, false colors, false cheeks, and
  all that is false, men naturally dislike, for in themselves they are a
  poor foundation on which to form family ties, consequently duplicity and
  hypocrisy in women is very much disliked by men, but a frank, honest,
  conscientious soul is always lovable and lovely and will not become an
  old maid, except as a matter of choice and not of necessity.</p>

  <p><b>1.</b> "It is not good for man to be alone," was the Divine
  judgment, and so God created for him an helpmate; therefore sex is as
  Divine as the soul. <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page133"></a>[133]</span></p>

  <p><b>2. Polygamy.</b>&mdash;Polygamy has existed in all ages. It is and
  always has been the result of moral degradation and wantonness.</p>

  <p><b>3. The Garden of Eden.</b>&mdash;The Garden of Eden was no harem.
  Primeval nature knew no community of love; there was only the union of
  two souls, and the twain were made one flesh. If God had intended man to
  be a polygamist he would have created for him two or more wives; but he
  only created one wife for the first man. He also directed Noah to take
  into the ark two of each sort&mdash;a male and female&mdash;another
  evidence that God believed in pairs only.</p>

  <p><b>4. Abraham</b> no doubt was a polygamist, and the general history
  of patriarchal life shows that the plurality of wives and concubinage
  were national customs, and not the institutions authorized by God.</p>

  <p><b>5. Egyptian History.</b>&mdash;Egyptian history, in the first
  ostensible form we have, shows that concubinage and polygamy were in
  common practice.</p>

  <p><b>6. Solomon.</b>&mdash;It is not strange that Solomon, with his
  thousand wives, exclaimed: "All is vanity and vexation of spirit."
  Polygamy is not the natural state of man.</p>

  <p><b>7. Concubinage and Polygamy</b> continued till the fifth century,
  when the degraded condition of woman became to some extent matters of
  some concern and recognition. Before this woman was regarded simply as an
  instrument of procreation, or a mistress of the household, to gratify the
  passions of man.</p>

  <p><b>8. The Chinese</b> marriage system was, and is, practically
  polygamous, for from their earliest traditions we learn, although a man
  could have but one wife, he was permitted to have as many concubines as
  he desired.</p>

  <p><b>9. Mohammedanism.</b>&mdash;Of the 150,000,000 Mohammedans all are
  polygamists. Their religion appeals to the luxury of animal propensities,
  and the voluptuous character of the Orientals has penetrated western
  Europe and Africa.</p>

  <p><b>10. Mormonism.</b>&mdash;The Mormon Church, founded by Joseph
  Smith, practiced polygamy until the beginning of 1893, when the church
  formally declared and resigned polygamy as a part or present doctrine of
  their religious institution. Yet all Mormons are polygamists at heart. It
  is a part of their religion; national law alone restrains them.</p>

  <p><b>11. Free Lovers.</b>&mdash;There is located at Lenox, Madison
  County, New York, an organization popularly known as Free Lovers. The
  members advocate a system of complex marriage, a sort of promiscuity,
  with a freedom of love for <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>[134]</span>any and all. Man offers woman support and
  love, woman enjoying freedom, self-respect, health, personal and mental
  competency, gives herself to man in the boundless sincerity of an
  unselfish union. In their system, love is made synonymous with sexuality,
  and there is no doubt but what woman is only a plaything to gratify
  animal caprice.</p>

  <p><b>12. Monogamy (Single Wife)</b>, is a law of nature evident from the
  fact that it fulfills the three essential conditions of man, viz.: the
  development of the individual, the welfare of society and reproduction.
  In no nation with a system of polygamy do we find a code of political and
  moral rights, and the condition of woman is that of a slave. In
  polygamous countries nothing is added to the education and civilization.
  The natural tendency is sensualism, and sensualism tends to mental
  starvation.</p>

  <p><b>13. Christian Civilization</b> has lifted woman from slavery to
  liberty. Wherever Christian civilization prevails there are legal
  marriages, pure homes and education. May God bless the purity of the
  home.</p>

<h2>Marriage.</h2>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The parties are wedded. The priest or clergyman has pronounced as one
  those hearts that before beat in unison with each other. The assembled
  guests congratulate the happy pair. The fair bride has left her dear
  mother bedewed with tears and sobbing just as if her heart would break,
  and as if the happy bridegroom was leading her away captive against her
  will. They enter the carriage. It drives off on the wedding tour, and his
  arms encircles the yielding waist of her now all his own, while her head
  reclines on the breast of the man of her choice. If she be young and has
  married an old man, she will be sad. If she has married for a home, or
  position, or wealth, a pang will shoot across her fair bosom. If she has
  married without due consideration or on too light an acquaintance, it
  will be her sorrow before long. But, if loving and beloved, she has
  united her destiny with a worthy man, she will rejoice, and on her
  journey feel a glow of <span class="correction" title="text reads `satsfaction'"

  </div>
  <p>1. Marriage is the natural state of man and woman. Matrimony greatly
  contributes to the wealth and health of man.</p>

  <p>2. Circumstances may compel a man not to select a companion until late
  in life. Many may have parents or relatives, dependent brothers and
  sisters to care for, yet family <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page136"></a>[136]</span>ties are cultivated, notwithstanding the
  home is without a wife.</p>

  <p>3. In Christian countries the laws of marriage have greatly added to
  the health of man. Marriage in barbarous countries, where little or no
  marriage ceremonies are required, benefits man but little. There can be
  no true domestic blessedness without loyalty and love for the select and
  married companion. All the licentiousness and lust of a libertine,
  whether civilized or uncivilized, bring him only unrest and premature
  decay.</p>

  <p>4. A man, however, may be married and not mated, and consequently reap
  trouble and unhappiness. A young couple should first carefully learn each
  other by making the courtship a matter of business, and sufficiently long
  that the disposition and temper of each may be thoroughly exposed and
  understood.</p>

  <p>5. First see that there is love; secondly, that there is adaptation;
  thirdly, see that there are no physical defects; and if these conditions
  are properly considered, cupid will go with you.</p>

  <p>6. The happiest place on all earth is home. A loving wife and lovely
  children are jewels without price, as Payne says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,</p>
      <p>Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>7. Reciprocated love produces a general exhilaration of the system.
  The elasticity of the muscles is increased, the circulation is quickened,
  and every bodily function is stimulated to renewed activity by a happy
  marriage.</p>

  <p>8. The consummation desired by all who experience this affection, is
  the union of souls in a true marriage. Whatever of beauty or romance
  there may have been in the lover's dream, is enhanced and spiritualized
  in the intimate communion of married life. The crown of wifehood and
  maternity is purer, more divine than that of the maiden. Passion is
  lost&mdash;emotions predominate.</p>

    AN ALGERIAN BRIDE.
  </div>
  <p>9. <b>Too Early Marriages.</b>&mdash;Too early marriage is always bad
  for the female. If a young girl marries, her system is weakened and a
  full development of her body is prevented, and the dangers of confinement
  are considerably increased.</p>

  <p>10. Boys who marry young derive but little enjoyment from the
  connubial state. They are liable to excesses and thereby lose much of the
  vitality and power of strength and physical endurance.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Long Life.</b>&mdash;Statistics show that married men live
  longer than bachelors. Child-bearing for women is conducive to
  longevity.</p>

<p><!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>[137]</span></p>

  <p>12. <b>Complexion.</b>&mdash;Marriage purifies the complexion, removes
  blotches from the skin, invigorates the body, fills up the tones of the
  voice, gives elasticity and firmness to the step, and brings health and
  contentment to old age.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Temptations Removed.</b>&mdash;Marriage sanctifies a home,
  while adultery and libertinism produce unrest, distrust and misery. It
  must be remembered that a married man can practice the most absolute
  continence and enjoy a far better state of health than the licentious
  man. The comforts of companionship develop purity and give rest to the
  soul.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Total Abstention.</b>&mdash;It is no doubt difficult for some
  men to fully abstain from sexual intercourse and be entirely chaste in
  mind. The great majority of men experience frequent strong sexual desire.
  Abstention is very apt to produce in their minds voluptuous images and
  untamable desires which require an iron will to banish or control. The
  hermit in his seclusion, or the monk in his retreat, are often flushed
  with these passions and trials. It is, however, natural; for remove these
  passions and man would be no longer a man. It is evident that the natural
  state of man is that of marriage; and he who avoids that state is not in
  harmony with the laws of his being.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Prostitution.</b>&mdash;Men who inherit strong passions easily
  argue themselves into the belief, either to practice <!-- Page 138
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>[138]</span>masturbation
  or visit places of prostitution, on the ground that their health demands
  it. Though medical investigation has proven it repeatedly to be false,
  yet many believe it. The consummation of marriage involves the mightiest
  issues of life and is the most holy and sacred right recognized by man,
  and it is the Balm of Gilead for many ills. Masturbation or prostitution
  soon blight the brightest prospects a young man may have. Manhood is
  morality and purity of purpose, not sensuality.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of Celibacy.</h2>

    Disadvantages of Celibacy.<br /> Keeping Bachelor's Hall.<br /> The Old
    Bachelor Sewing on His Buttons.
  </div>
  <p>1. To live the life of a bachelor has many advantages and many
  disadvantages. The man who commits neither fornication, adultery nor
  secret vice, and is pure in mind, surely has all the moral virtues that
  make a good man and a good citizen, whether married or unmarried.</p>

  <p>2. If a good pure-minded man does not marry, he will suffer no serious
  loss of vital power; there will be no tendency to spermatorrh&oelig;a or
  congestion, nor will he be afflicted with any one of those ills which
  certain vicious writers and quacks would lead many people to believe.
  Celibacy is perfectly consistent with mental vigor and physical strength.
  Regularity in the habits of life will always have its good effects on the
  human body.</p>

  <p>3. The average life of a married man is much longer than that of a
  bachelor. There is quite an alarming odds in the United States in favor
  of a man with a family. It is claimed that the married man lives on an
  average from five to twenty years longer than a bachelor. The married man
  lives a more regular life. He has his meals more regularly and is better
  nursed in sickness, and in every way a happier and more contented man.
  The happiness of wife and children will always add comfort and length of
  days to the man who is happily married.</p>

  <p>4. It is a fact well answered by statistics that there is more crime
  committed, more vices practiced, and more immorality among single men
  than among married men. Let the young man be pure in heart like Bunyan's
  Pilgrim, and he can pass the deadly dens, the roaring lions, and overcome
  the ravenous fires of passion, unscathed. The vices of single men support
  the most flagrant of evils of modern society, hence let every young man
  beware and keep his body clean and pure. His future happiness largely
  depends upon his chastity while a single man.</p>

      alt="We shall never marry." title="We shall never marry." /></a>
    "WE SHALL NEVER MARRY."
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Modern Origin.</b>&mdash;The prejudice which certainly still
  exists in the average mind against unmarried women must be of
  comparatively modern origin. From the earliest ages, in ancient Greece,
  and Rome particularly, the highest <!-- Page 141 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>[141]</span>honors were paid them.
  They were the ministers of the old religions, and regarded with
  superstitious awe.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Matrimony.</b>&mdash;Since the reformation, especially during
  the last century, and in our own land, matrimony has been so much
  esteemed, notably by women, that it has come to be regarded as in some
  sort discreditable for them to remain single. Old maids are mentioned on
  every hand with mingled pity and disdain, arising no doubt from the
  belief, conscious or unconscious, that they would not be what they are if
  they could help it. Few persons have a good word for them as a class. We
  are constantly hearing of lovely maidens, charming wives, buxom widows,
  but almost never of attractive old maids.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Discarding Prejudice.</b>&mdash;The real old maid is like any
  other woman. She has faults necessarily, though not those commonly
  conceived of. She is often plump, pretty, amiable, interesting,
  intellectual, cultured, warm-hearted, benevolent, and has ardent friends
  of both sexes. These constantly wonder why she has not married, for they
  feel that she must have had many opportunities. Some of them may know
  why; she may have made them her confidantes. She usually has a
  sentimental, romantic, frequently a sad and pathetic past, of which she
  does not speak unless in the sacredness of intimacy.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Not Quarrelsome.</b>&mdash;She is not dissatisfied, querulous
  nor envious. On the contrary, she is, for the most part, singularly
  content, patient and serene,&mdash;more so than many wives who have
  household duties and domestic cares to tire and trouble them.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Remain Single from Necessity.</b>&mdash;It is a stupid, as well
  as a heinous mistake, that women who remain single do so from necessity.
  Almost any woman can get a husband if she is so minded, as daily
  observation attests. When we see the multitudes of wives who have no
  visible signs of matrimonial recommendation, why should we think that old
  maids have been totally neglected? We may meet those who do not look
  inviting. But we meet any number of wives who are even less inviting.</p>

    "WE HAVE CHANGED OUR MINDS."
  </div>
  <p>6. <b>First Offer.</b>&mdash;The appearance and outgiving of many
  wives denote that they have accepted the first offer; the appearance and
  outgiving of many old maids that they have declined repeated offers. It
  is undeniable, that wives, in the mass, have no more charm than old maids
  have, in the mass. But, as the majority of women are married, they are no
  more criticised nor commented on, in the bulk, than the whole sex are.
  They are spoken of individually as pretty or <!-- Page 143 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>[143]</span>plain, bright or dull,
  pleasant or unpleasant; while old maids are judged as a species, and
  almost always unfavorable.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Becomes a Wife.</b>&mdash;Many an old maid, so-called,
  unexpectedly to her associates becomes a wife, some man of taste,
  discernment and sympathy having induced her to change her state. Probably
  no other man of his kind has proposed before, which accounts for her
  singleness. After her marriage hundreds of persons who had sneered at her
  condition find her charming, thus showing the extent of their prejudice
  against feminine celibacy. Old maids in general, it is fair to presume,
  do not wait for opportunities, but for proposers of an acceptable sort.
  They may have, indeed they are likely to have, those, but not to meet
  these.</p>

  <p>8. <b>No Longer Marry for Support.</b>&mdash;The time has changed and
  women have changed with it. They have grown more sensible, more
  independent in disposition as well as circumstances. They no longer marry
  for support; they have proved their capacity to support themselves, and
  self-support has developed them in every way. Assured that they can get
  on comfortably and contentedly alone they are better adapted by the
  assurance for consortship. They have rapidly increased from this and
  cognate causes, and have so improved in person, mind and character that
  an old maid of to-day is wholly different from an old maid of forty years
  ago.</p>

<h2>When and Whom to Marry.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Early Marriages.</b>&mdash;Women too early married always remain
  small in stature, weak, pale, emaciated, and more or less miserable. We
  have no natural nor moral right to perpetuate unhealthy constitutions,
  therefore women should not marry too young and take upon themselves the
  responsibility, by producing a weak and feeble generation of children. It
  is better not to consummate a marriage until a full development of body
  and mind has taken place. A young woman of twenty-one to twenty-five, and
  a young man of twenty-three to twenty-eight, are considered the right age
  in order to produce an intelligent and healthy offspring. "First make the
  tree good, then shall the fruit be good also."</p>

  <p>2. If marriage is delayed too long in either sex, say from thirty to
  forty-five, the offspring will often be puny and more liable to insanity,
  idiocy, and other maladies.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Puberty.</b>&mdash;This is the period when childhood passes from
  immaturity of the sexual functions to maturity. Woman attains this state
  a year or two sooner than man. In the hotter climates the period of
  puberty is from twelve to fifteen years of age, while in cold climates,
  such as Russia, the United States, and Canada, puberty is frequently
  delayed until the seventeenth year.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Diseased Parents.</b>&mdash;We do the race a serious wrong in
  multiplying the number of hereditary invalids. Whole families of children
  have fallen heir to lives of misery and suffering by the indiscretion and
  poor judgment of parents. No young man in the vigor of health should
  think for a moment of marrying a girl who has the impress of consumption
  or other disease already stamped upon her feeble constitution. It only
  multiplies his own suffering, and brings no material happiness to his
  invalid wife. On the other hand, no healthy, vigorous young woman ought
  to unite her destiny with a man, no matter how much she adored him, who
  is not healthy and able to brave the hardships of life. If a young man or
  young woman with feeble body cannot find permanent relief either by
  medicine or change of climate, no thoughts of marriage should be
  entertained. Courting a patient may be pleasant, but a hard thing in
  married life to enjoy. The young lady who supposes that any young man
  wishes to marry her for the sake of nursing her through life makes a very
  grave mistake.</p>

  </div>
  <p>5. <b>Whom to Choose for a Husband.</b>&mdash;The choice of a husband
  requires the coolest judgment and the most <!-- Page 146 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>[146]</span>vigilant sagacity. A
  true union based on organic law is happiness, but let all remember that
  oil and water will not mix; the lion will not lie down with the lamb, nor
  can ill-assorted marriages be productive of aught but discord.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12hg3">"Let the woman take</p>
      <p>An elder than herself, so wears she to him&mdash;</p>
      <p>So sways she, rules in her husband's heart."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Look carefully at the disposition.&mdash;See that your intended spouse
  is kind-hearted, generous, and willing to respect the opinions of others,
  though not in sympathy with them. Don't marry a selfish tyrant who thinks
  only of himself.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Be Careful.</b>&mdash;Don't marry an intemperate man with a view
  of reforming him. Thousands have tried it and failed. Misery, sorrow and
  a very hell on earth have been the consequences of too many such generous
  undertakings.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The True and Only Test</b> which any man should look for in
  woman is modesty in demeanor before marriage, absence both of assumed
  ignorance and disagreeable familiarity, and a pure and religious frame of
  mind. Where these are present, he need not doubt that he has a faithful
  and a chaste wife.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Marrying First Cousins</b> is dangerous to offspring. The
  observation is universal, the children of married first cousins are too
  often idiots, insane, clump-footed, crippled, blind, or variously
  diseased. First cousins are always sure to impart all the hereditary
  disease in both families to their children. If both are healthy there is
  less danger.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Do Not Choose One Too Good</b>, or too far above you, lest the
  inferior dissatisfying the superior, breed those discords which are worse
  than the trials of a single life. Don't be too particular; for you might
  go farther and fare worse. As far as you yourself are faulty, you should
  put up with faults. Don't cheat a consort by getting one much better than
  you can give. We are not in heaven yet, and must put up with their
  imperfections, and instead of grumbling at them, be glad they are no
  worse; remembering that a faulty one is a great deal better than none, if
  he loves you.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Marrying for Money.</b>&mdash;Those who seek only the society
  of those who can boast of wealth will nine times out of ten suffer
  disappointment. Wealth cannot manufacture true love nor money buy
  domestic happiness. Marry because you love each other, and God will bless
  your home. A cottage with a loving wife is worth more than a royal palace
  with a discontented and unloving queen. <!-- Page 147 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>[147]</span></p>

  <p>11. <b>Difference in Age.</b>&mdash;It is generally admitted that the
  husband should be a few years older than the wife. The question seems to
  be how much difference. Up to twenty-two those who propose marriage
  should be about the same age; however, other things being equal, a
  difference of fifteen years after the younger is twenty-five, need not
  prevent a marriage. A man of forty-five may marry a woman of twenty-five
  much more safely than one of thirty a girl below nineteen, because her
  mental sexuality is not as mature as his, and again her natural coyness
  requires more delicate and affectionate treatment than he is likely to
  bestow. A girl of twenty or under should seldom if ever marry a man of
  thirty or over, because the love of an elderly man for a girl is more
  parental than conjugal; while hers for him is like that of a daughter to
  a father. He may pet, flatter and indulge her as he would a grown-up
  daughter, yet all this is not genuine masculine and feminine love, nor
  can she exert over him the influence every man requires from his
  wife.</p>

  <p>12. <b>The Best Time.</b>&mdash;All things considered, we advise the
  male reader to keep his desires in check till he is at least twenty-five,
  and the female not to enter the pale of wedlock until she has attained
  the age of twenty. After those periods, marriage is the proper sphere of
  action, and one in which nearly every individual is called by nature to
  play his proper part.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Select Carefully.</b>&mdash;While character, health,
  accomplishments and social position should be considered, yet one must
  not overlook mental construction and physical conformation. The rule
  always to be followed in choosing a life partner is <i>identity of taste
  and diversity of temperament</i>. Another essential is that they be
  physically adapted to each other. For example: The pelvis&mdash;that part
  of the anatomy containing all the internal organs of gestation&mdash;is
  not only essential to beauty and symmetry, but is a matter of vital
  importance to her who contemplates matrimony, and its usual consequences.
  Therefore, the woman with a very narrow and contracted pelvis should
  never choose a man of giant physical development lest they cannot duly
  realize the most important of the enjoyments of the marriage state, while
  the birth of large infants will impose upon her intense labor pains, or
  even cost her her life. <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3>CHOOSE INTELLECTUALLY&mdash;LOVE AFTERWARD.</h3>

    Explaining the Necessity for a New Bonnet.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Love.</b>&mdash;Let it ever be remembered that love is one of
  the most sacred elements of our nature, and the most dangerous with which
  to tamper. It is a very beautiful and delicately contrived faculty,
  producing the most delightful results, but easily thrown out of
  repair&mdash;like a tender plant, the delicate fibers of which incline
  gradually to entwine themselves around its beloved one, uniting two
  willing hearts by a thousand endearing ties, and making of "twain one
  flesh"; but they are easily torn asunder, and then adieu to the joys of
  connubial bliss! <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>[149]</span></p>

  <p>2. <b>Courting by the Quarter.</b>&mdash;This courting by the quarter,
  "here a little and there a little," is one of the greatest evils of the
  day. This getting a little in love with Julia, and then a little with
  Eliza, and a little more with Mary,&mdash;this fashionable flirtation and
  coquetry of both sexes&mdash;is ruinous to the domestic affections;
  besides, effectually preventing the formation of true connubial love. I
  consider this dissipation of the affections one of the greatest sins
  against Heaven, ourselves, and the one trifled with, that can be
  committed.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Frittering Away Affections.</b>&mdash;Young men commence
  courting long before they think of marrying, and where they entertain no
  thoughts of marriage. They fritter away their own affections, and pride
  themselves on their conquests over the female heart; triumphing in having
  so nicely fooled them. They pursue this sinful course so far as to drive
  their pitiable victims, one after another, from respectable society, who,
  becoming disgraced, retaliate by heaping upon them all the indignities
  and impositions which the fertile imagination of woman can invent or
  execute.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Courting Without Intending to Marry.</b>&mdash;Nearly all this
  wide-spread crime and suffering connected with public and private
  licentiousness and prostitution, has its origin in these unmeaning
  courtships&mdash;this premature love&mdash;this blighting of the
  affections, and every young man who courts without intending to marry, is
  throwing himself or his sweetheart into <i>this hell upon earth</i>. And
  most of the blame rests on young men, because they take the liberty of
  paying their addresses to the ladies and discontinuing them, at pleasure,
  and thereby mainly cause this vice.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Setting Their Caps.</b>&mdash;True, young ladies sometimes "set
  their caps," sometimes court very hard by their bewitching smiles and
  affectionate manners; by the natural language of love, or that backward
  reclining and affectionate roll of the head which expresses it; by their
  soft and persuasive accents; by their low dresses, artificial forms, and
  many other unnatural and affected ways and means of attracting attention
  and exciting love; but women never court till they have been in love and
  experienced its interruption, till their first and most tender fibres of
  love have been frostbitten by disappointment. It is surely a sad
  condition of society.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs151.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/151.jpg"
      alt="Hasty familiarity is fraught with many dangers." title="Hasty familiarity is fraught with many dangers." /></a>
    "HASTY FAMILIARITY IS FRAUGHT WITH MANY DANGERS."
  </div>
  <p>6. <b>Trampling the Affections of Women.</b>&mdash;But man is a
  self-privileged character. He may not only violate the laws of his own
  social nature with impunity, but he may even trample upon the affections
  of woman. He may even carry <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>[151]</span>this sinful indulgence to almost any
  length, and yet be caressed and smiled tenderly upon by woman; aye, even
  by virtuous woman. He may call out, only to blast the glowing affections
  of one young lady after another, and yet his addresses be cordially
  welcomed by others. Surely a gentleman is at perfect liberty to pay his
  addresses, not only to a lady, but even to the ladies, although he does
  not once entertain the thought of marrying his sweet-heart, or, rather
  his victim. O, man, how depraved! O, woman, how strangely blind to your
  own rights and interests!</p>

  <p>7. <b>An Infallible Sign.</b>&mdash;An infallible sign that a young
  man's intentions are improper, is his trying to excite your passions. If
  he loves you, he will never appeal to that feeling, because he respects
  you too much for that. And the woman who allows a man to take advantage
  of her just to compel him to marry her, is lost and heartless in the last
  degree, and utterly destitute of moral principle as well as virtue. A
  woman's riches is her virtue, that gone she has lost all.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Beginning of Licentiousness.</b>&mdash;Man it seldom drives
  from society. Do what he may, woman, aye, virtuous and even pious woman
  rarely excludes him from her list of visitors. But where is the point of
  propriety?&mdash;immoral transgression should exclude either sex from
  respectable society. Is it that one false step which now constitutes the
  boundary between virtue and vice? Or rather, the discovery of that false
  step? Certainly not! but it is all that leads to, and precedes and
  induces it. It is this courting without marrying. This is the beginning
  of licentiousness, as well as its main, procuring cause, and therefore
  infinitely worse than its consummation merely.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Searing the Social Affections.</b>&mdash;He has seared his
  social affections so deeply, so thoroughly, so effectually, that when, at
  last, he wishes to marry, he is incapable of loving. He marries, but is
  necessarily cold-hearted towards his wife, which of course renders her
  wretched, if not jealous, and reverses the faculties of both towards each
  other; making both most miserable for life. This induces contention and
  mutual recrimination, if not unfaithfulness, and imbitters the marriage
  relations through life; and well it may.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Unhappy Marriages.</b>&mdash;This very cause, besides inducing
  most of that unblushing public and private prostitution already alluded
  to, renders a large proportion of the marriages of the present day
  unhappy. Good people mourn over the result, but do not once dream of its
  cause. They even pray for moral reform, yet do the very things that
  increase the evil. <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a

    AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.
  </div>
  <p>11. <b>Weeping Over Her Fallen Son.</b>&mdash;Do you see yonder godly
  mother, weeping over her fallen son, and remonstrating with him in tones
  of a mother's tenderness and importunity? That very mother prevented that
  very son marrying the girl he dearly loved, because she was poor, and
  this interruption of his love was the direct and procuring cause of his
  ruin; for, if she had allowed him to marry this beloved one, he never
  would have thought of giving his "strength unto strange women." True, the
  mother ruined her son ignorantly, but none the less effectually.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Seduction and Ruin.</b>&mdash;That son next courts another
  virtuous fair one, engages her affections, and ruins her, or else leaves
  her broken-hearted, so that she is the more easily ruined by others, and
  thus prepares the way for her becoming an inmate of a house "whose steps
  take hold on hell." His heart is now indifferent, he is ready for
  anything.</p>

  <p>13. <b>The Right Principle.</b>&mdash;I say then, with emphasis, that
  no man should ever pay his addresses to any woman, until he has made his
  selection, not even to aid him in making that choice. He should first
  make his selection intellectually, and love afterward. He should go about
  the matter coolly and with judgment, just as he would undertake any other
  important matter. No man or woman, when blinded by love, is in a fit
  state to judge advantageously as to what he or she requires, or who is
  adapted to his or her wants.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Choosing First and Loving Afterwards.</b>&mdash;I know, indeed,
  that this doctrine of choosing first and loving afterward, of excluding
  love from the councils, and of choosing by and with the consent of the
  intellect and moral sentiments, is entirely at variance with the feelings
  of the young and the customs of society; but, for its correctness, I
  appeal to the common-sense&mdash;not to the experience, for so few try
  this plan. Is not this the only proper method, and the one most likely to
  result happily? Try it.</p>

  <p>15. <b>The Young Woman's Caution.</b>&mdash;And, especially, let no
  young lady ever once think of bestowing her affections till she is
  certain they will not be broken off&mdash;that is, until the match is
  fully agreed upon; but rather let her keep her heart whole till she
  bestows it for life. This requisition is as much more important, and its
  violation as much more disastrous to woman than to man, as her social
  faculties are stronger than his.</p>

  <p>16. <b>A Burnt Child Dreads the Fire.</b>&mdash;As a "burnt child
  dreads the fire," and the more it is burnt, the greater the dread: so
  your affections, once interrupted, will recoil from a second love, and
  distrust all mankind. No! you cannot be too choice of your
  love&mdash;that pivot on which turn your destinies for life and future
  happiness.</p>

  <p>"Thunderstorms clear the atmosphere and promote vegetation; then why
  not Love-spats promote love, as they certainly often do?</p>

  <p>They are almost universal, and in the nature of our differences cannot
  be helped. The more two love, the more they are aggrieved by each other's
  faults; of which these spats are but the correction.</p>

  <p>Love-spats instead of being universal, they are consequent on
  imperfect love, and only aggravate, never correct errors. Sexual storms
  never improve, whereas love obviates faults by praising the opposite
  virtues. Every view of them, practical and philosophical, condemns them
  as being to love what poison is to health, both before and after
  marriage. They are nothing but married discords. Every law of mind and
  love condemns them. Shun them as you would deadly vipers, and prevent
  them by forestallment."&mdash;O. S. Fowler.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>1. <b>The True Facts.</b>&mdash;Notwithstanding some of the above
  quotations, to the contrary, trouble and disagreement between lovers
  embitters both love and life. Contention is always dangerous, and will
  beget alienation if not final separation.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Confirmed Affections.</b>&mdash;Where affections are once
  thoroughly confirmed, each one should be very careful in taking offense,
  and avoid all disagreements as far as possible, but if disagreements
  continually develop with more or less friction and irritation, it is
  better for the crisis to come and a final separation take place. For
  peace is better than disunited love.</p>

      alt="Cupid's rebellion." title="Cupid's rebellion." /></a>
    CUPID'S REBELLION
  </div>
  <p>3. <b>Hate-Spats.</b>&mdash;Hate-spats, though experienced by most
  lovers, yet, few realize how fatal they are to subsequent affections.
  Love-spats develop into hate-spats, and their effects upon the affections
  are blighting and should not under any circumstances be tolerated. Either
  agree, or agree to disagree. If there cannot be harmony before the ties
  of marriage are assumed, then there cannot be harmony <!-- Page 156
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>[156]</span>after. Married
  life will be continually marred by a series of "hate-spats" that sooner
  or later will destroy all happiness, unless the couple are reasonably
  well mated.</p>

  <p>4. <b>More Fatal the Oftener They Occur.</b>&mdash;As O. S. Fowler
  says: "'The poison of asps is under their lips.' The first spat is like a
  deep gash cut into a beautiful face, rendering it ghastly, and leaving a
  fearful scar, which neither time nor cosmetics can ever efface; including
  that pain so fatal to love, and blotting that sacred love-page with
  memory's most hideous and imperishable visages. Cannot many now unhappy
  remember them as the beginning of that alienation which embittered your
  subsequent affectional cup, and spoiled your lives? With what inherent
  repulsion do you look back upon them? Their memory is horrid, and effect
  on love most destructive."</p>

  <p>5. <b>Fatal Conditions.</b>&mdash;What are all lovers' "spats" but
  disappointment in its very worst form? They necessarily and always
  produce all its terrible consequences. The finer feelings and
  sensibilities will soon become destroyed and nothing but hatred will
  remain.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Extreme Sorrow.</b>&mdash;After a serious "spat" there generally
  follows a period of tender sorrow, and a feeling of humiliation and
  submission. Mutual promises are consequently made that such a condition
  of things shall never happen again, etc. But be sure and remember, that
  every subsequent difficulty will require stronger efforts to repair the
  breach. Let it be understood that these compromises are dangerous, and
  every new difficulty increases their fatality. Even the strongest will
  endure but few, nor survive many.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Distrust and Want of Confidence.</b>&mdash;Most difficulties
  arise from distrust or lack of confidence or common-sense. When two
  lovers eye each other like two curs, each watching, lest the other should
  gain some new advantage, then this shows a lack of common-sense, and the
  young couple should get sensible or separate.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Jealousy.</b>&mdash;When one of the lovers, once so tender, now
  all at once so cold and hardened; once so coy and familiar, now suddenly
  so reserved, distant, hard and austere, is always a sure case of
  jealousy. A jealous person is first talkative, very affectionate, and
  then all at once changes and becomes cold, reserved and repulsive,
  apparently without cause. If a person is jealous before marriage, this
  characteristic will be increased rather than diminished by marriage. <!--
  Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>[157]</span></p>

  <p>9. <b>Confession.</b>&mdash;If you make up by confession, the
  confessor feels mean and disgraced; or if both confess and forgive, both
  feel humbled; since forgiveness implies inferiority and pity; from which
  whatever is manly and womanly shrinks. Still even this is better than
  continued "spats."</p>

  <p>10. <b>Prevention.</b>&mdash;If you can get along well in your
  courtship you will invariably make a happy couple if you should unite
  your destinies in marriage. Learn not to give nor take offence. You must
  remember that all humanity is imperfect at best. We all have our faults,
  and must keep them in subordination. Those who truly love each other will
  have but few difficulties in their courtship or in married life.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Remedies.</b>&mdash;Establishing a perfect love in the
  beginning constitutes a preventive. Fear that they are not truly loved
  usually paves the way for "spats." Let all who make any pretension guard
  against all beginnings of this reversal, and strangle these "hate-spats"
  the moment they arise. "Let not the sun go down upon thy wrath," not even
  an hour, but let the next sentence after they begin quench them forever.
  And let those who cannot court without "spats," stop; for those who spat
  before marriage, must quarrel after.</p>

    A BROKEN HEART
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Wounded Love.</b>&mdash;Tis true that love wields a magic,
  sovereign, absolute, and tyrannical power over both the body and the mind
  when it is given control. It often, in case of disappointment, works
  havoc and deals death blows to its victims, and leaves many in that
  morbid mental condition which no life-tonics simply can restore. Wounded
  love may be the result of hasty and indiscreet conduct of young people;
  or the outgrowth of lust, or the result of domestic infidelity and
  discord.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Fatal Effects.</b>&mdash;Our cemeteries receive within the cold
  shadows of the grave thousands and thousands of victims that annually die
  from the results of "broken hearts." It is no doubt a fact that love
  troubles cause more disorders of the heart than everything else
  combined.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Disrupted Love.</b>&mdash;It has long been known that dogs,
  birds, and even horses, when separated from their companions or friends,
  have pined away and died; so it is not strange that man with his higher
  intuitive ideas of affection should suffer from love when suddenly
  disrupted.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Crucifying Love.</b>&mdash;Painful love feelings strike right to
  the heart, and the breaking up of love that cannot be consummated in
  marriage is sometimes allowed to crucify the affections. There is no
  doubt that the suffering from disappointed love is often deeper and more
  intense than meeting death itself.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Healing.</b>&mdash;The paralyzing and agonizing consequences of
  ruptured love can only be remedied by diversion and society. Bring the
  mind into a state of patriotic independence with a full determination to
  blot out the past. Those who cannot bring into subordination the pangs of
  disappointment in love are not strong characters, and invariably will
  suffer disappointments in almost every department of life. Disappointment
  in love means rising above it, and conquering it, or demoralization,
  mental, physical and sexual.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Love Runs Mad.</b>&mdash;Love comes unbidden. A blind
  ungovernable impulse seems to hold sway in the passions of the
  affections. Love is blind and seems to completely subdue and conquer. It
  often comes like a clap of thunder from a clear sky, and when it falls it
  falls flat, leaving only the ruins of a tornado behind.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Bad, Dismal, and Blue Feelings.</b>&mdash;Despondency breathes
  disease, and those who yield to it can neither work, eat nor sleep; they
  only suffer. The spell-bound, fascinated, magnetized affections seem to
  deaden self-control and no <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>[160]</span>doubt many suffering from love-sickness
  are totally helpless; they are beside themselves, irritational and wild.
  Men and women of genius, influence and education, all seem to suffer
  alike, but they do not yield alike to the subduing influence; some pine
  away and die; others rise above it, and are the stronger and better for
  having been afflicted.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Rise above It.</b>&mdash;Cheer up! If you cannot think
  pleasurably over your misfortune, forget it. You must do this or perish.
  Your power and influence is too much to blight by foolish and
  melancholicy pining. Your own sense, your self-respect, your self-love,
  your love for others, command you not to spoil yourself by crying over
  "spilt milk."</p>

    MARRIAGE ON A DEATHBED.
  </div>
  <p>9. <b>Retrieve Your Past Loss.</b>&mdash;Do sun, moon, and stars
  indeed rise and set in your loved one? Are there not "as good fish in the
  sea as ever were caught?" and can you not catch them? Are there not other
  hearts on earth just as loving and lovely, and in every way as congenial?
  If circumstances had first turned you upon another, you would have felt
  about that one as now about this. Love depends far less on the party
  loved than on the loving one. Or is this the way either to retrieve your
  past loss, or provide for the future? Is it not both unwise and
  self-destructive; and in every way calculated to render your case,
  present and prospective, still more hopeless?</p>

  <p>10. <b>Find Something to Do.</b>&mdash;Idle hands are Satan's
  workshop. Employ your mind; find something to do; something in which you
  can find self-improvement; something that will fit you better to be
  admired by someone else, read, and improve your mind; get into society,
  throw your whole soul into some new enterprise, and you will conquer with
  glory and come out of the fire purified and made more worthy.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Love Again.</b>&mdash;As love was the cause of your suffering,
  so love again will restore you, and you will love better and more
  consistently. Do not allow yourself to become soured and detest and shun
  association. Rebuild your dilapidated sexuality by cultivating a general
  appreciation of the excellence, especially of the mental and moral
  qualities of the opposite sex. Conquer your prejudices, and vow not to
  allow anyone to annoy or disturb your calmness.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Love for the Dead.</b>&mdash;A most affectionate woman, who
  continues to love her affianced though long dead, instead of becoming
  soured or deadened, manifests all the richness and sweetness of the
  fully-developed woman thoroughly in love, along with a softened, mellow,
  twilight sadness which touches every heart, yet throws a peculiar lustre
  and beauty over her manners and entire character. She must mourn, <!--
  Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>[161]</span>but
  not forever. It is not her duty to herself or to her Creator.</p>

  <p>13. <b>A Sure Remedy.</b>&mdash;Come in contact with the other sex.
  You are infused with your lover's magnetism, which must remain till
  displaced by another's. Go to parties and picnics; be free, familiar,
  offhand, even forward; try your knack at fascinating another, and yield
  to fascinations yourself. But be honest, command respect, and make
  yourself attractive and worthy.</p>

<h2>Former Customs and Peculiarities Among Men.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Polygamy.</b>&mdash;There is a wide difference as regards the
  relations of the sexes in different parts of the world. In some parts
  polygamy has prevailed from time immemorial.</p>

  <p>Most savage people are polygamists, and the Turks, though slowly
  departing from the practice, still allow themselves a plurality of
  wives.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Rule Reversed.</b>&mdash;In Thibet the rule is reversed, and the
  females are provided with two or more husbands. It is said that in many
  instances a whole family of brothers have but one wife. The custom has at
  least one advantageous feature, viz.: the possibility of leaving an
  unprotected widow and a number of fatherless children is entirely
  obviated.</p>

  <p>3. <b>The Morganatic Marriage</b> is a modification of polygamy. It
  sometimes occurs among the royalty of Europe, and is regarded as
  perfectly legitimate, but the morganatic wife is of lower rank than her
  royal husband, and her children do not inherit his rank or fortune. The
  Queen only is the consort of the sovereign, and entitled to share his
  rank.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Different Manners of Obtaining Wives.</b>&mdash;Among the
  uncivilized almost any envied possession is taken by brute force or
  superior strength. The same is true in obtaining a wife. The strong take
  precedence of the weak. It is said that among the North American Indians
  it was the custom for men to wrestle for the choice of women. A weak man
  could seldom retain a wife that a strong man coveted.</p>

  <p>The law of contest was not confined to individuals alone. Women were
  frequently the cause of whole tribes arraying themselves against each
  other in battle. The effort to excel in physical power was a great
  incentive to bodily development, and since the best of the men were
  preferred by the most superior women, the custom was a good one in this,
  that the race was improved.</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Aboriginal Australian</b> employed low cunning and heartless
  cruelty in obtaining his wife. Laying in ambush, with club in hand, he
  would watch for the coveted woman, <!-- Page 163 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>[163]</span>and, unawares, spring
  upon her. If simply disabled he carried her off as his possession, but if
  the blow had been hard enough to kill, he abandoned her to watch for
  another victim. There is here no effort to attract or please, no contest
  of strength; his courtship, if courtship it can be called, would compare
  very unfavorably with any among the brute creation.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Kalmuck Tartar</b> races for his bride on horseback, she
  having a certain start previously agreed upon. The <i>nuptial knot</i>
  consists in catching her, but we are told that the result of the race all
  depends upon whether the girl wants to be caught or not.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Sandwich Islanders.</b>&mdash;Marriage among the early natives
  of these islands was merely a matter of mutual inclination. There was no
  ceremony at all, the men and women united and separated as they felt
  disposed.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Feudal Lord</b>, in various parts of Europe, when any of his
  dependents or followers married, exercised the right of assuming the
  bridegroom's proper place in the marriage couch for the first night.
  Seldom was there any escape from this abominable practice. Sometimes the
  husband, if wealthy, succeeded in buying off the petty sovereign from
  exercising his privilege.</p>

  <p>9. <b>The Spartans</b> had the custom of encouraging intercourse
  between their best men and women for the sake of a superior progeny,
  without any reference to a marriage ceremony. Records show that the
  ancient Roman husband has been known to invite a friend, in whom he may
  have admired some physical or mental trait, to share the favors of his
  wife, that the peculiar qualities that he admired might be repeated in
  the offspring.</p>

<h2>Sensible Hints in Choosing a Partner.</h2>

  <p>1. There are many fatal errors and many love-making failures in
  courtship. Natural laws govern all nature and reduce all they govern to
  eternal right; therefore love naturally, not artificially. Don't love a
  somebody or a nobody simply because they have money.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Court Scientifically.</b>&mdash;If you court at all, court
  scientifically. Bungle whatever else you will, but do <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `no'">not</span> bungle courtship. A
  failure in this may mean more than a loss of wealth or public honors; it
  may mean ruin, or a life often worse than death. The world is full of
  wretched and mismated people.</p>

  <p><b>Begin right</b> and all will be right; begin wrong and all will end
  wrong. When you court, make a business of it and study your interest the
  same as you would study any other business proposition.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Divorces.</b>&mdash;There is not a divorce on our court records
  that is not the result of some fundamental error in courtship. The purity
  or the power of love may be corrupted the same as any other faculty, and
  when a man makes up his mind to marry and shuts his eyes and grabs in the
  dark for a companion, he dishonors the woman he captures and commits a
  crime against God and society. In this enlightened age there should be
  comparatively few mistakes made in the selection of a suitable partner.
  Sufficient time should be taken to study each other's character and
  disposition. Association will soon reveal adaptability.</p>

  <p>4. <b>False Love.</b>&mdash;Many a poor, blind and infatuated novice
  thinks he is desperately in love, when there is not the least genuine
  affection in his nature. It is all a momentary <!-- Page 166 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>[166]</span>passion, a sort of
  puppy love; his vows and pledges are soon violated, and in wedlock he
  will become indifferent and cold to his wife and children, and he will go
  through life without ambition, encouragement or success. He will be a
  failure. True love speaks for itself, and the casual observer can read
  its proclamations. True love does not speak in a whisper. It always makes
  itself heard. The follies of flirting develop into many unhappy
  marriages, and blight many a life. A man happily married has superior
  advantages both socially and financially.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Flirting just for Fun.</b>&mdash;Who is the flirt, what is his
  reputation, motive, or character? Every young man and woman must have a
  reputation; if it is not good it is bad, there is no middle ground. Young
  people who are running in the streets after dark, boisterous and noisy in
  their conversation, gossiping and giggling, flirting with first one and
  then another, will soon settle their matrimonial prospects among good
  society. Modesty is a priceless jewel. No sensible young man with a
  future will marry a flirt.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Arch-Deceiver.</b>&mdash;They who win the affection simply
  for their own amusement are committing a great sin for which there is no
  adequate punishment. How can you shipwreck the innocent life of that
  confiding maiden, how can you forget her happy looks as she drank in your
  expressions of love, how can you forget her melting eyes and glowing
  cheeks, her tender tone reciprocating your pretended love? Remember that
  God is infinitely just, and "the soul that sinneth shall surely die." You
  may dash into business, seek pleasure in the club room, and visit
  gambling hells, but "Thou art the man" will ever stare you in the face.
  Her pale, sad cheeks, her hollow eyes will never cease to haunt you. Men
  should promote happiness, and not cause misery. Let the savage Indians
  torture captives to death by the slow flaming fagot, but let civilized
  man respect the tenderness and love of confiding women. Torturing the
  opposite sex is double-distilled barbarity. Young men agonizing young
  ladies, is the cold-blooded cruelty of devils, not men.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Rule to Follow.</b>&mdash;Do not continually pay your
  attentions to the same lady if you have no desire to win her affections.
  Occasionally escorting her to church, concert, picnic, party, etc., is
  perfectly proper; but to give her your special attention, and extend
  invitations to her for all places of amusements where you care to attend,
  is an implied promise that you prefer her company above all others, and
  she has a right to believe that your attentions are serious. <!-- Page

    THE WEDDING RING.
  </div>
  <p>8. <b>Every Girl Should Seal Her Heart</b> against all manifested
  affections, unless they are accompanied by a proposal. Woman's love is
  her all, and her heart should be as flint until she finds one who is
  worthy of her confidence. Young woman, never bestow your affections until
  by some word or deed at least you are fully justified in recognizing
  sincerity and faith in him who is paying you special attention. Better
  not be engaged until twenty-two. You are <!-- Page 168 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>[168]</span>then more competent to
  judge the honesty and falsity of man. Nature has thrown a wall of
  maidenly modesty around you. Preserve that and not let your affections be
  trifled with while too young by any youthful flirt who is in search of
  hearts to conquer.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Female Flirtation.</b>&mdash;The young man who loves a young
  woman has paid her the highest compliment in the possession of man.
  Perpetrate almost any sin, inflict any other torture, but spare him the
  agony of disappointment. It is a crime that can never be forgiven, and a
  debt that never can be paid.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Loyalty.</b>&mdash;Young persons with serious intentions, or
  those who are engaged should be thoroughly loyal to each other. If they
  seek freedom with others the flame of jealousy is likely to be kindled
  and love is often turned to hatred, and the severest anger of the soul is
  aroused. Loyalty, faithfulness, confidence, are the three jewels to be
  cherished in courtship. Don't be a flirt.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Kissing, Fondling, and Caressing Between Lovers.</b>&mdash;This
  should never be tolerated under any circumstances, unless there is an
  engagement to justify it, and then only in a sensible and limited way.
  The girl who allows a young man the privilege of kissing her or putting
  his arms around her waist before engagement will at once fall in the
  estimation of the man she has thus gratified and desired to please.
  Privileges always injure, but never benefit.</p>

    SAYING "NO" WHEN MEANING "YES."
  </div>
  <p>12. <b>Improper Liberties During Courtship Kill Love.</b>&mdash;Any
  improper liberties which are permitted by young ladies, whether engaged
  or not, will change love into sensuality, and her affections will become
  obnoxious, if not repellent. Men by nature love virtue, and for a life
  companion naturally shun an amorous woman. Young folks, as you love moral
  purity and virtue, never reciprocate love until you have required the
  right of betrothal. Remember that those who are thoroughly in love will
  respect the honor and virtue of each other. The purity of woman is doubly
  attractive, and sensuality in her becomes doubly offensive and repellent.
  It is contrary to the laws of nature for a man to love a harlot.</p>

  <p>13. <b>A Seducer.</b>&mdash;The punishment of the seducer is best
  given by O. S. Fowler, in his "Creative Science." The sin and punishment
  rest on all you who call out only to blight a trusting, innocent, loving
  virgin's affections, and then discard her. You deserve to be horsewhipped
  by her father, cowhided by her brothers, branded villain by her mother,
  cursed by herself, and sent to the whipping-post and dungeon. <!-- Page
  169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>[169]</span></p>

  <p>14. <b>Caution.</b>&mdash;A young lady should never encourage the
  attentions of a young man, who shows no interest in his sisters. If a
  young man is indifferent to his sisters he will become indifferent to his
  wife as soon as the honey moon is over. There are few if any exceptions
  to this rule. The brother who will not be kind and loving in his mother's
  home will make a very poor husband.</p>

  <p>15. <b>The Old Rule:</b> "Never marry a man that does not make his
  mother a Christmas present every Christmas," is a good one. The young
  lady makes no mistake in uniting her destinies with the man that loves
  his mother and respects his sisters and brothers.</p>

<h2>SAFE HINTS.</h2>

      alt="A Chinese bride and groom." title="A Chinese bride and groom." /></a>
    A CHINESE BRIDE AND GROOM.
  </div>
  <p>1. Marry in your own position in life. If there is any difference in
  social position, it is better that the husband should be the superior. A
  woman does not like to look down upon her husband, and to be obliged to
  do so is a poor guarantee for their happiness.</p>

  <p>2. It is best to marry persons of your own faith and religious
  convictions, unless one is willing to adopt those of the other.
  Difference of faith is apt to divide families, and to produce great
  trouble in after life. A pious woman should beware of marrying an
  irreligious man. <!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page171"></a>[171]</span></p>

  <p>3. Don't be afraid of marrying a poor man or woman. Good health,
  cheerful disposition, stout hearts and industrious hands will bring
  happiness and comfort.</p>

  <p>4. Bright red hair should marry jet black, and jet black auburn or
  bright red, etc. And the more red-faced and bearded or impulsive a man,
  the more dark, calm, cool and quiet should his wife be; and vice versa.
  The florid should not marry the florid, but those who are dark, in
  proportion as they themselves are light.</p>

  <p>5. Red-whiskered men should marry brunettes, but no blondes; the color
  of the whiskers being more determinate of the temperament than that of
  the hair.</p>

  <p>6. The color of the eyes is still more important. Gray eyes must marry
  some other color, almost any other except gray; and so of blue, dark,
  hazel, etc.</p>

  <p>7. Those very fleshy should not marry those equally so, but those too
  spare and slim; and this is doubly true of females. A spare man is much
  better adapted to a fleshy woman than a round-favored man. Two who are
  short, thick-set and stocky, should not unite in marriage, but should
  choose those differently constituted; but on no account one of their own
  make. And, in general, those predisposed to corpulence are therefore less
  inclined to marriage.</p>

  <p>8. Those with little hair or beard should marry those whose hair is
  naturally abundant; still those who once had plenty, but who have lost
  it, may marry those who are either bald or have but little; for in this,
  as in all other cases, all depends on what one is by nature, little on
  present states.</p>

  <p>9. Those whose motive-temperament decidedly predominates, who are
  bony, only moderately fleshy, quite prominent-featured, Roman-nosed and
  muscular, should not marry those similarly formed.</p>

  <p>10. Small, nervous men must not marry little, nervous or sanguine
  women, lest both they and their children have quite too much of the
  hot-headed and impulsive, and die suddenly.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

    Light, Life, Health and Beauty.
  </div>
  <p>11. Two very beautiful persons rarely do or should marry; nor two
  extra homely. The fact is a little singular that very handsome women, who
  of course can have their pick, rarely marry good-looking men, but
  generally give preference to those who are homely; because that <!-- Page
  173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>[173]</span>exquisiteness in which beauty originates
  naturally blends with that power which accompanies huge noses and
  disproportionate features.</p>

  <p>12. Rapid movers, speakers, laughers, etc., should marry those who are
  calm and deliberate, and impulsives those who are stoical; while those
  who are medium may marry those who are either or neither, as they
  prefer.</p>

  <p>13. Noses indicate characters by indicating the organisms and
  temperaments. Accordingly, those noses especially marked either way
  should marry those having opposite nasal characteristics. Roman noses are
  adapted to those which turn up, and pug noses to those turning down;
  while straight noses may marry either.</p>

  <p>14. Men who love to command must be especially careful not to marry
  imperious, women's-rights woman; while those who willingly "obey order;"
  need just such. Some men require a wife who shall take their part; yet
  all who do not need strong-willed women, should be careful how they marry
  them.</p>

  <p>15. A sensible woman should not marry an obstinate but injudicious,
  unintelligent man; because she cannot long endure to see and help him
  blindly follow his poor, but spurn her good, plans.</p>

  <p>16. The reserved or secretive should marry the frank. A cunning man
  cannot endure the least artifice in a wife. Those who are non-committal
  must marry those who are demonstrative; else, however much they may love,
  neither will feel sure as to the other's affections, and each will
  distrust the other, while their children will be deceitful.</p>

  <p>17. A timid woman should never marry a hesitating man, lest, like
  frightened children, each keep perpetually re-alarming the other by
  imaginary fears.</p>

  <p>18. An industrious, thrifty, hard-working man should marry a woman
  tolerably saving and industrious. As the "almighty dollar" is now the
  great motor-wheel of humanity, and that to which most husbands devote
  their entire lives, to delve alone is uphill work.</p>

  <p>1. <b>Seek Each Other's Happiness.</b>&mdash;A selfish marriage that
  seeks only its own happiness defeats itself. Happiness is a fire that
  will not burn long on one stick. <!-- Page 175 --><span

  <p>2. <b>Do Not Marry Suddenly.</b>&mdash;It can always be done till it
  is done, if it is a proper thing to do.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Marry in Your Own Grade in Society.</b>&mdash;It is painful to
  be always apologizing for any one. It is more painful to be apologized
  for.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Do Not Marry Downward.</b>&mdash;It is hard enough to advance in
  the quality of life without being loaded with clay heavier than your own.
  It will be sufficiently difficult to keep your children up to your best
  level without having to correct a bias in their blood.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Do Not Sell Yourself.</b>&mdash;It matters not whether the price
  be money or position.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Do Not Throw Yourself Away.</b>&mdash;You will not receive too
  much, even if you are paid full price.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Seek the Advice of Your Parents.</b>&mdash;Your parents are your
  best friends. They will make more sacrifice for you than any other
  mortals. They are elevated above selfishness concerning you. If they
  differ from you concerning your choice, it is because they must.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Do Not Marry to Please Any Third Party.</b>&mdash;You must do

  <p>11. <b>Do Not Marry to Get Rid of Anybody.</b>&mdash;The coward who
  shot himself to escape from being drafted was insane.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Do Not Marry Merely for the Impulse of Love.</b>&mdash;Love is
  a principle as well as an emotion. So far as it is a sentiment it is a
  blind guide. It does not wait to test the presence of exalted character
  in its object before breaking out into a flame. Shavings make a hot fire,
  but hard coal is better for the Winter.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Do Not Marry Without Love.</b>&mdash;A body without a soul soon
  becomes offensive.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Test Carefully the Effect of Protracted
  Association.</b>&mdash;If familiarity breeds contempt before marriage it
  will afterward.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Test Carefully the Effect of Protracted
  Separation.</b>&mdash;True love will defy both time and space.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Consider Carefully</b> the right of your children under the
  laws of heredity. It is doubtful whether you have a right to increase the
  number of invalids and cripples.</p>

  <p>17. <b>Do Not Marry Simply Because You Have Promised to Do
  So.</b>&mdash;If a seam opens between you now it will widen into <!--
  Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>[176]</span>a
  gulf. It is less offensive to retract a mistaken promise than to perjure
  your soul before the altar. Your intended spouse has a right to absolute
  integrity.</p>

  <p>18. <b>Marry Character.</b>&mdash;It is not so much what one has as
  what one is.</p>

  <p>19. <b>Do Not Marry the Wrong Object.</b>&mdash;Themistocles said he
  would rather marry his daughter to a man without <!-- Page 177 --><span

  <span class="correction" title="text reads `with'">without</span> a man.
  It is well to have both. It is fatal to have neither.</p>

  <p>20. <b>Demand a Just Return.</b>&mdash;You give virtue and purity, and
  gentleness and integrity. You have a right to demand the same in return.
  Duty requires it.</p>

  <p>21. <b>Require Brains.</b>&mdash;Culture is good, but will not be
  transmitted. Brain power may be.</p>

  <p>22. <b>Study Past Relationship.</b>&mdash;The good daughter and sister
  makes a good wife. The good son and brother makes a good husband.</p>

  <p>23. <b>Never Marry as a Missionary Deed.</b>&mdash;If one needs saving
  from bad habits he is not suitable for you.</p>

  <p>24. <b>Marriage is a Sure and Specific Remedy</b> for all the ills
  known as seminal losses. As right eating cures a sick stomach and right
  breathing diseased lungs, so the right use of the sexual organs will
  bring relief and restoration. Many men who have been sufferers from
  indiscretions of youth, have married, and were soon cured of
  spermatorrh&oelig;a and other complications which accompanied it.</p>

  <p>25. <b>A Good, Long Courtship</b> will often cure many difficulties or
  ills of the sexual organs. O. S. Fowler says: "See each other often spend
  many pleasant hours together," have many walks and talks, think of each
  other while absent, write many love letters, be inspired to many love
  feelings and acts towards each other, and exercise your sexuality in a
  thousand forms ten thousand times, every one of which tones up and
  thereby recuperates this very element now dilapidated. When you have
  courted long enough to marry, you will be sufficiently restored to be
  reimproved by it. Come,</p>

  <p><b>Up and at it.</b>&mdash;Dress up, spruce up, and be on the alert.
  Don't wait too long to get one much more perfect than you are; but settle
  on some one soon. Remember that your unsexed state renders you
  over-dainty, and easily disgusted. So contemplate only their lovable
  qualities.</p>

  <p>26. <b>Purity of Purpose.</b>&mdash;Court with a pure and loyal
  purpose, and when thoroughly convinced that the disposition of other
  difficulties are in the way of a happy marriage life, then
  <i>honorably</i> discuss it and honorably treat each other in the
  settlement.</p>

  <p>27. <b>Do not trifle</b> with the feelings or affections of each
  other. It is a sin that will curse you all the days of your life.</p>

<h2>Women Who Make the Best Wives.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Conscious of the Duties of Her Sex.</b>&mdash;A woman conscious
  of the duties of her sex, one who unflinchingly discharges the duties
  allotted to her by nature, would no doubt make a good wife.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Good Wives and Mothers.</b>&mdash;The good wives and mothers are
  the women who believe in the sisterhood of women as well as in the
  brotherhood of men. The highest exponent of this type seeks to make her
  home something more than an abode where children are fed, clothed and
  taught the catechism. The State has taken her children into politics by
  making their education a function of politicians. The good wife and
  homemaker says to her children, "Where thou goest, I will go." She puts
  off her own inclinations to ease and selfishness. She studies the men who
  propose to educate her children; she exhorts mothers to sit beside
  fathers on the school-board; she will even herself accept such thankless
  office in the interests of the helpless youth of the schools who need a
  mother's as well as a father's and a teacher's care in this field of
  politics.</p>

  <p>3. <b>A Busy Woman.</b>&mdash;As to whether a busy woman, that is, a
  woman who labors for mankind in the world outside her home,&mdash;whether
  such an one can also be a good housekeeper, and care for her children,
  and make a real "Home, Sweet Home!" with all the comforts by way of
  variation, why! I am ready, as the result of years practical experience
  as a busy woman, to assert that women of affairs can also be women of
  true domestic tastes and habits.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Brainy Enough.</b>&mdash;What kind of women make the best wives?
  The woman who is brainy enough to be a companion, wise enough to be a
  counsellor, skilled enough in the domestic virtues to be a good
  housekeeper, and loving enough to guide in true paths the children with
  whom the home may be blessed.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Found the Right Husband.</b>&mdash;The best wife is the woman
  who has found the right husband, a husband who understands her. A man
  will have the best wife when he rates that wife as queen among women. Of
  all women she should always be to him the dearest. This sort of man will
  not only praise the dishes made by his wife, but will actually eat
  them.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

    PUNISHMENT OF WIFE BEATERS IN NEW ENGLAND IN THE EARLY DAYS.
  </div>
  <p>6. <b>Bank Account.</b>&mdash;He will allow his life-companion a bank
  account, and will exact no itemized bill at the end of the month. Above
  all, he will pay the Easter bonnet bill without a word, never bring a
  friend to dinner without first telephoning home,&mdash;short, he will
  comprehend that the <!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page180"></a>[180]</span>woman who makes the best wife is the woman
  whom, by his indulgence of her ways and whims, he makes the best wife. So
  after all, good husbands have the most to do with making good wives.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Best Home Maker.</b>&mdash;A woman to be the best home maker
  needs to be devoid of intensive "nerves." She must be neat and
  systematic, but not too neat, lest she destroy the comfort she endeavors
  to create. She must be distinctly amiable, while firm. She should have no
  "career," or desire for a career, if she would fill to perfection the
  home sphere. She must be affectionate, sympathetic and patient, and fully
  appreciative of the worth and dignity of her sphere.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Know Nothing Whatsoever About Cooking or Sewing or
  Housekeeping.</b>&mdash;I am inclined to make my answer to this question
  somewhat concise, after the manner of a text without the sermon. Like
  this: To be the "best wife" depends upon three things: first, an abiding
  faith with God; second, duty lovingly discharged as daughter, wife and
  mother; third, self-improvement, mentally, physically, spiritually. With
  this as a text and as a glittering generality, let me touch upon one or
  two practical essentials. In the course of every week it is my privilege
  to meet hundreds of young women,&mdash;prospective wives. I am astonished
  to find that many of these know nothing whatsoever about cooking or
  sewing or housekeeping. Now, if a woman cannot broil a beefsteak, nor
  boil the coffee when it is necessary, if she cannot mend the linen, nor
  patch a coat, if she cannot make a bed, order the dinner, create a
  lamp-shade, ventilate the house, nor do anything practical in the way of
  making home actually a home, how can she expect to make even a good wife,
  not to speak of a better or best wife? I need not continue this sermon.
  Wise girls will understand.</p>

  <p>9. <b>The Best Keeper of Home.</b>&mdash;As to who is the best keeper
  of this transition home, memory pictures to me a woman grown white under
  the old slavery, still bound by it, in that little-out-of-the-way Kansas
  town, but never so bound that she could not put aside household tasks, at
  any time, for social intercourse, for religious conversation, for
  correspondence, for reading, and, above all, for making everyone who came
  near her feel that her home was the expression of herself, a place for
  rest, study, and the cultivation of affection. She did not exist for her
  walls, her carpets, her furniture; they existed for her and all who came
  to her. She considered herself the equal of all; and everyone else
  thought her the superior of all.</p>

<h2>Adaptation, Conjugal Affection, and
Fatal Errors.</h2>

<hr class="short" >

<h3>ADVICE TO THE MARRIED AND UNMARRIED.</h3>

  <p>1. <b>Marrying for Wealth.</b>&mdash;Those who marry for wealth often
  get what they marry and nothing else; for rich girls, besides being
  generally destitute of both industry and economy, are generally
  extravagant in their expenditures, and require servants enough to
  dissipate a fortune. They generally have insatiable wants, yet feel that
  they deserve to be indulged in everything, because they placed their
  husbands under obligation to them by bringing them a dowry. And then the
  mere idea of living on the money of a wife, and of being supported by
  her, is enough to tantalize any man of an independent spirit.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Self-Support.</b>&mdash;What spirited husband would not prefer
  to support both himself and wife, rather than submit to this perpetual
  bondage of obligation. To live upon a father, or take a patrimony from
  him, is quite bad enough; but to run in debt to a wife, and owe her a
  living, is a little too aggravating for endurance, especially if there be
  not perfect cordiality between the two, which cannot be the case in money
  matches. Better live wifeless, or anything else, rather than marry for
  money.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Money-Seekers.</b>&mdash;Shame on sordid wife-seekers, or,
  rather, money-seekers; for it is not a wife that they seek, but only
  filthy lucre! They violate all their other faculties simply to gratify
  miserly desire. Verily such "have their reward"!</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Penitent Hour.</b>&mdash;And to you, young ladies, let me
  say with great emphasis, that those who court and marry you because you
  are rich, will make you rue the day of your pecuniary espousals. They
  care not for you, but only your money, and when they get that, will be
  liable to neglect or abuse you, and probably squander it, leaving you
  destitute and abandoning you to your fate.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Industry the Sign of Nobility.</b>&mdash;Marry a working,
  industrious young lady, whose constitution is strong, flesh solid, and
  health unimpaired by confinement, bad habits, or late hours. Give me a
  plain, home-spun farmer's daughter, and you may have all the rich and
  fashionable belles of our cities and villages.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs183.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/183.jpg"
      alt="An ill-mated couple." title="An ill-mated couple." /></a>
    AN ILL-MATED COUPLE.
  </div>
  <p>6. <b>Wasp Waists.</b>&mdash;Marrying small waists is attended with
  consequences scarcely less disastrous than marrying <!-- Page 183
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>[183]</span>rich and
  fashionable girls. An amply developed chest is a sure indication of a
  naturally vigorous constitution and a strong hold on life; while small
  waists indicate small and feeble vital organs, a delicate constitution,
  sickly offspring, and a short life. Beware of them, therefore, unless you
  wish your heart broken by the early death of your wife and children.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Marrying Talkers.</b>&mdash;In marrying a wit or a talker
  merely, though the brilliant scintillations of the former, or the
  garrulity of the latter, may amuse or delight you for the time being, yet
  you will derive no permanent satisfaction from these qualities, for there
  will be no common bond of kindred feeling to assimilate your souls and
  hold each spell-bound at the shrine of the other's intellectual or moral
  excellence.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Second Wife.</b>&mdash;Many men, especially in choosing a
  second wife, are governed by her own qualifications as a housekeeper
  mainly, and marry industry and economy. Though these traits of character
  are excellent, yet a good housekeeper may be far from being a good wife.
  A good housekeeper, but a poor wife, may indeed prepare you a good
  dinner, and keep her house and children neat and tidy, yet this is but a
  part of the office of a wife; who, besides all her household duties, has
  those of a far higher order to perform. She should soothe you with her
  sympathies, divert your troubled mind, and make the whole family happy by
  the gentleness of her manners, and the native goodness of her heart. A
  husband should also likewise do his part.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Do Not Marry a Man With a Low, Flat Head</b>; for, however
  fascinating, genteel, polite, tender, plausible or winning he may be, you
  will repent the day of your espousal.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Healthy Wives and Mothers.</b>&mdash;Let girls romp, and let
  them range hill and dale in search of flowers, berries, or any other
  object of amusement or attraction; let them bathe often, skip the rope,
  and take a smart ride on horseback; often interspersing these amusements
  with a turn of sweeping or washing, in order thereby to develop their
  vital organs, and thus lay a substantial physical foundation for becoming
  good wives and mothers. The wildest romps usually make the best wives,
  while quiet, still, demure, sedate and sedentary girls are not worth
  having.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Small Stature.</b>&mdash;In passing, I will just remark, that
  good size is important in wives and mothers. A small stature is
  objectionable in a woman, because little women <!-- Page 184 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>[184]</span>usually have too much
  activity for their strength, and, consequently, feeble constitutions;
  hence they die young, and besides, being nervous, suffer extremely as
  mothers.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Hard Times and Matrimony.</b>&mdash;Many persons, particularly
  young men, refuse to marry, especially "these hard times," because they
  cannot support a wife in the style they wish. To this I reply, that a
  good wife will care less for the style in which she is supported, than
  for you. She will cheerfully conform to your necessities, and be happy
  with you in a log-cabin. She will even help you support yourself. To
  support a good wife, even if she have children, is really less expensive
  than to board alone, besides being one of the surest means of acquiring
  property.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Marrying for a Home.</b>&mdash;Do not, however, marry for a
  home merely, unless you wish to become even more destitute with one than
  without one; for, it is on the same footing with "marrying for money."
  Marry a man for his merit, and you take no chances.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Marry to Please No One But Yourself.</b>&mdash;Marriage is a
  matter exclusively your own; because you alone must abide its
  consequences. No person, not even a parent, has the least right to
  interfere or dictate in this matter. I never knew a marriage, made to
  please another, to turn out any otherwise than most unhappily.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Do Not Marry to Please Your Parents.</b> Parents cannot love
  for their children any more than they can eat or sleep, or breathe, or
  die and go to heaven for them. They may give wholesome advice merely, but
  should leave the entire decision to the unbiased judgment of the parties
  themselves, who mainly are to experience the consequences of their
  choice. Besides, such is human nature, that to oppose lovers, or to speak
  against the person beloved, only increases their desire and determination
  to marry.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Run-Away Matches.</b>&mdash;Many a run-away match would never
  have taken place but for opposition or interference. Parents are mostly
  to be blamed for these elopements. Their children marry partly out of
  spite and to be contrary. Their very natures tell them that this
  interference is unjust&mdash;as it really is&mdash;and this excites
  combativeness, firmness, and self-esteem, in combination with the social
  faculties, to powerful and even blind resistance&mdash;which turmoil of
  the faculties hastens the match. Let the affections of a daughter be once
  slightly enlisted in your favor, and then let the "old folks" start an
  opposition, and you may feel sure of your prize. If she did not love you
  before, she will now, that you are persecuted. <!-- Page 185 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>[185]</span></p>

  <p>17. <b>Disinheritance.</b>&mdash;Never disinherit, or threaten to
  disinherit, a child for marrying against your will. If you wish a
  daughter not to marry a certain man, oppose her, and she will be sure to
  marry him; so also in reference to a son.</p>

  <p>18. <b>Proper Training.</b>&mdash;The secret is, however, all in a
  nutshell. Let the father properly train his daughter, and she will bring
  her first love-letter to him, and give him an opportunity to cherish a
  suitable affection, and to nip an improper one in the germ, before it has
  time to do any harm.</p>

  <p>19. <b>The Fatal Mistakes of Parents.</b>&mdash;<i>There is, however,
  one way of effectually preventing an improper match, and that is, not to
  allow your children to associate with any whom you are unwilling they
  should marry. How cruel as well as unjust, to allow a daughter to
  associate with a young man till the affections of both are riveted, and
  then forbid her marrying him. Forbid all association or consent
  cheerfully to the marriage.</i></p>

  <p>20. <b>An Intemperate Lover.</b>&mdash;Do not flatter yourselves,
  young women, that you can wean even an occasional wine drinker from his
  cups by love and persuasion. Ardent spirit at first, kindles up the fires
  of love into the fierce flames at burning licentiousness, which burn out
  every element of love and destroy every vestige of pure affection. It
  over-excites the passions, and thereby finally destroys
  it,&mdash;producing at first, unbridled libertinism, and then an utter
  barrenness of love; besides reversing the other faculties of the drinker
  against his own consort, and those of the wife against her drinking
  husband.</p>

<hr class="full" >

<h2>FIRST LOVE, DESERTION AND DIVORCE.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>First Love.</b>&mdash;This is the most important direction of
  all. The first love experiences a tenderness, a purity and
  unreservedness, an exquisiteness, a devotedness, and a poetry belonging
  to no subsequent attachment. "Love, like life, has no second spring."
  Though a second attachment may be accompanied by high moral feeling, and
  to a devotedness to the object loved; yet, let love be checked or
  blighted in its first pure emotion, and the beauty of its spring is
  irrecoverably withered and lost. This does not mean the simple love of
  children in the first attachment they call love, but rather the mature
  intelligent love of those of suitable age.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

    CONSIDERING THE QUESTION.
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>[187]</span></p>

  <p>2. <b>Free from Temptations.</b>&mdash;As long as his heart is bound
  up in its first bundle of love and devotedness&mdash;as long as his
  affections remain reciprocated and uninterrupted&mdash;so long
  temptations cannot take effect. His heart is callous to the charms of
  others, and the very idea of bestowing his affections upon another is
  abhorrent. Much more so is animal indulgence, which is morally
  impossible.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Second Love not Constant.</b>&mdash;But let this first love be
  broken off, and the flood-gates of passion are raised. Temptations now
  flow in upon him. He casts a lustful eye upon every passing female, and
  indulges unchaste imaginations and feelings. Although his
  conscientiousness or intellect may prevent actual indulgence, yet
  temptations now take effect, and render him liable to err; whereas before
  they had no power to awaken improper thoughts or feelings. Thus many
  young men find their ruin.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Legal Marriage.</b>&mdash;What would any woman give for merely a
  nominal or legal husband, just to live with and provide for her, but who
  entertained not one spark of love for her, or whose affections were
  bestowed upon another? How absurd, how preposterous the doctrine that the
  obligations of marriage derive their sacredness from legal enactments and
  injunctions! How it literally profanes this holy of holies, and drags
  down this heaven-born institution from its original, divine elevation, to
  the level of a merely human device. Who will dare to advocate the human
  institution of marriage without the warm heart of a devoted and loving
  companion!</p>

  <p>5. <b>Legislation.</b>&mdash;But no human legislation can so guard
  this institution but that it may be broken in spirit, though, perhaps,
  acceded to in form; for, it is the heart which this institution requires.
  There must be true and devoted affection, or marriage is a farce and a
  failure.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Marriage Ceremony and the Law Governing Marriage</b> are for
  the protection of the individual, yet a man and woman may be married by
  law and yet unmarried in spirit. The law may tie together, and no
  marriage be consummated. Marriage therefore is Divine, and "whom God hath
  joined together let no man put asunder." A right marriage means a right
  state of the heart. A careful study of this work will be a great help to
  both the unmarried and the married.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Desertion and Divorce.</b>&mdash;For a young man to court a
  young woman, and excite her love till her affections are riveted, and
  then (from sinister motives, such as, to marry one richer, or more
  handsome), to leave her, and try <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>[188]</span>elsewhere, is the very
  same crime as to divorce her from all that she holds dear on
  earth&mdash;to root up and pull out her imbedded affections, and to tear
  her from her rightful husband. First love is always constant. The second
  love brings uncertainty&mdash;too often desertions before marriage and
  divorces after marriage.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Coquet.</b>&mdash;The young woman to play the coquet, and
  sport with the sincere affections of an honest and devoted young man, is
  one of the highest crimes that human nature can commit. Better murder him
  in body too, as she does in soul and morals, and it is the result of
  previous disappointment, never the outcome of a sincere first love.</p>

  <p>9. <b>One Marriage.</b> One evidence that second marriages are
  contrary to the laws of our social nature, is the fact that almost all
  step-parents and step-children disagree. Now, what law has been broken,
  to induce this penalty? The law of marriage; and this is one of the ways
  in which the breach punishes itself. It is much more in accordance with
  our natural feelings, especially those of mothers, that children should
  be brought up by their own parent.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Second Marriage.</b>&mdash;Another proof of this point is, that
  second marriage is more a matter of business. "I'll give you a home, if
  you'll take care of my children." "It's a bargain," is the way most
  second matches are made. There is little of the poetry of first-love, and
  little of the coyness and shrinking diffidence which characterize the
  first attachment. Still these remarks apply almost equally to a second
  attachment, as to second marriage.</p>

  <p>11. <b>The Conclusion of the Whole Matter.</b>&mdash;Let this portion
  be read and pondered, and also the one entitled, "Marry your First Love
  if possible," which assigns the cause, and points out the only remedy, of
  licentiousness. As long as the main cause of this vice exists, and is
  aggravated by purse-proud, high-born, aristocratic parents and friends,
  and even by the virtuous and religious, just so long, and exactly in the
  same ratio will this blighting Sirocco blast the fairest flowers of
  female innocence and lovliness, and blight our noblest specimens of
  manliness. No sin of our land is greater.</p>

    HOW MANY YOUNG GIRLS ARE RUINED.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>No Excuse.</b>&mdash;In this country there is no excuse for the
  young man who seeks the society of the loose and the dissolute. There is
  at all times and everywhere open to him a society of persons of the
  opposite sex of his own age and of pure thoughts and lives, whose
  conversation will refine him and drive from his bosom ignoble and impure
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>2. <b>The Dangers.</b>&mdash;The young man who may take pleasure in
  the fact that he is the hero of half a dozen or more <!-- Page 191
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>[191]</span>engagements
  and love episodes, little realizes that such constant excitement often
  causes not only dangerously frequent and long-continued nocturnal
  emissions, but most painful affections of the testicles. Those who show
  too great familiarity with the other sex, who entertain lascivious
  thoughts, continually exciting the sexual desires, always suffer a
  weakening of power and sometimes the actual diseases of degeneration,
  chronic inflammation of the gland, spermatorrh&oelig;a, impotence, and
  the like.&mdash;Young man, beware; your punishment for trifling with the
  affections of others may cost you a life of affliction.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Remedy.</b>&mdash;Do not violate the social laws. Do not trifle
  with the affections of your nature. Do not give others countless anguish,
  and also do not run the chances of injuring yourself and others for life.
  The society of refined and pure women is one of the strongest safeguards
  a young man can have, and he who seeks it will not only find
  satisfaction, but happiness. Simple friendship and kind affections for
  each other will ennoble and benefit.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Time for Marriage.</b>&mdash;When a young man's means permit
  him to marry, he should then look intelligently for her with whom he
  expects to pass the remainder of his life in perfect loyalty, and in
  sincerity and singleness of heart. Seek her to whom he is ready to swear
  to be ever true.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Breach of Confidence.</b>&mdash;Nothing is more certain, says
  Dr. Naphey, to undermine domestic felicity, and sap the foundation of
  marital happiness, than marital infidelity. The risks of disease which a
  married man runs in impure intercourse are far more serious, because they
  not only involve himself, but his wife and his children. He should know
  that there is nothing which a woman will not forgive sooner than such a
  breach of confidence. He is exposed to the plots and is pretty certain
  sooner or later to fall into the snares of those atrocious parties who
  subsist on blackmail. And should he escape these complications, he still
  must lose self-respect, and carry about with him the burden of a guilty
  conscience and a broken vow.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Society Rules and Customs.</b>&mdash;A young man can enjoy the
  society of ladies without being a "flirt." He can escort ladies to
  parties, public places of interest, social gatherings, etc., without
  showing special devotion to any one special young lady. When he finds the
  choice of his heart, then he will be justified to manifest it, and
  publicly proclaim it by paying her the compliment, exclusive attention.
  To keep a lady's company six months is a public announcement of an
  engagement.</p>

<h2>A Word to Maidens.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>No Young Lady</b> who is not willing to assume the
  responsibility of a true wife, and be crowned with the sacred diadem of
  motherhood, should ever think of getting married. We have too many young
  ladies to-day who despise maternity, who openly vow that they will never
  be burdened with children, and yet enter matrimony at the first
  opportunity. What is the result? Let echo answer, What? Unless a young
  lady believes that motherhood is noble, is honorable, is divine, and she
  is willing to carry out that sacred function of her nature, she had a
  thousand times better refuse every proposal, and enter some honorable
  occupation and wisely die an old maid by choice.</p>

  <p>2. <b>On the Other Hand, Young Lady</b>, never enter into the physical
  relations of marriage with a man until you have conversed with him freely
  and fully on these relations. Learn distinctly his views and feelings and
  expectations in regard to that purest and most ennobling of all the
  functions of your nature, and the most sacred of all intimacies of
  conjugal love. Your self-respect, your beauty, your glory, your heaven,
  as a wife, will be more directly involved in his feelings and views and
  practices, in regard to that relation, than in all other things. As you
  would not become a weak, miserable, imbecile, unlovable and degraded wife
  and mother, in the very prime of your life, come to a perfect
  understanding with your chosen one, ere you commit your person to his
  keeping in the sacred intimacies of home. Beware of that man who, under
  pretence of delicacy, modesty, and propriety, shuns conversation with you
  on this relation, and on the hallowed function of maternity.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Talk With Your Intended</b> frankly and openly. Remember,
  concealment and mystery in him, towards you, on all other subjects
  pertaining to conjugal union might be overlooked, but if he conceals his
  views here, rest assured it bodes no good to your purity and happiness as
  a wife and mother. You can have no more certain assurance that you are to
  be victimized, your soul and body offered up, <i>slain</i>, on the altar
  of his sensualism, than his unwillingness to converse with you on
  subjects so vital to your happiness. Unless he is willing to hold his
  manhood in abeyance to the calls of your nature and to your conditions,
  and consecrate its passions and its powers to the elevation and happiness
  of his wife and children, your maiden soul had better return to God
  unadorned with the diadem of conjugal and maternal love than that you
  should become the wife of such a man and the mother of his children. <!--

    Uniformed Men are always Popular with the Ladies.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Making the Declaration.</b>&mdash;There are few emergencies in
  business and few events in life that bring to man the trying ordeal of
  "proposing to a lady." We should be glad to help the bashful lover in his
  hours of perplexity, embarrassment and hesitation, but unfortunately we
  cannot pop the question for him, nor give him a formula by which <!--
  Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>[195]</span>he
  may do it. Different circumstances and different surroundings compel
  every lover to be original in his form or mode of proposing.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Bashfulness.</b>&mdash;If a young man is very bashful, he should
  write his sentiments in a clear, frank manner on a neat white sheet of
  note paper, enclose it in a plain white envelope and find some way to
  convey it to the lady's hand.</p>

  <p>3. <b>The Answer.</b>&mdash;If the beloved one's heart is touched, and
  she is in sympathy with the lover, the answer should be frankly and
  unequivocally given. If the negative answer is necessary, it should be
  done in the kindest and most sympathetic language, yet definite, positive
  and to the point, and the gentleman should at once withdraw his suit and
  continue friendly but not familiar.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Saying "No" for "Yes."</b>&mdash;If girls are foolish enough to
  say "No" when they mean "Yes," they must suffer the consequences which
  often follow. A man of intelligence and self-respect will not ask a lady
  twice. It is begging for recognition and lowers his dignity, should he do
  so. A lady is supposed to know her heart sufficiently to consider the
  question to her satisfaction before giving an answer.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Confusion of Words and Misunderstanding.</b>&mdash;Sometimes a
  man's happiness, has depended on his manner of popping the question. Many
  a time the girl has said "No" because the question was so worded that the
  affirmative did not come from the mouth naturally; and two lives that
  gravitated toward each other with all their inward force have been thrown
  suddenly apart, because the electric keys were not carefully touched.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Scriptural Declaration.</b>&mdash;The church is not the proper
  place to conduct a courtship, yet the following is suggestive and
  ingenious.</p>

  <p>A young gentleman, familiar with the Scriptures, happening to sit in a
  pew adjoining a young lady for whom he conceived a violent attachment,
  made his proposal in this way: He politely handed his neighbor a Bible
  open, with a pin stuck in the following text: Second Epistle of John,
  verse 5:</p>

  <p>"And I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment
  unto thee, but that we had from the beginning, that we love one
  another."</p>

  <p>She returned it, pointing to the second chapter of Ruth, verse 10:
  "Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said
  unto him. Why have I found grace in <!-- Page 197 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>[197]</span>thine eyes that thou
  shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?"</p>

  <p>He returned the book, pointing to the 13th verse of the Third Epistle
  of John: "Having many things to write unto you, I would not write to you
  with paper and ink, but trust to come unto you and speak face to face,
  that your joy may be full."</p>

  <p>From the above interview a marriage took place the ensuing month in
  the same church.</p>

  <p>8. <b>A Romantic Way for Proposing.</b>&mdash;In Peru they have a
  romantic way of popping the question. The suitor appears on the appointed
  evening, with a gaily dressed troubadour, under the balcony of his
  beloved. The singer steps before her flower-bedecked window, and sings
  her beauties in the name of her lover. He compares her size to that of a
  pear-tree, her lips to two blushing rose-buds, and her womanly form to
  that of a dove. With assumed harshness the lady asks her lover: "Who are
  you, and what do you want?" He answers with ardent confidence: "Thy love
  I do adore, The stars live in the harmony of love, and why should not we,
  too, love each other?" Then the proud beauty gives herself away: she
  takes her flower-wreath from her hair and throws it down to her lover,
  promising to be his forever.</p>

<h2>The Wedding.</h2>

      alt="THE BRIDE." title="THE BRIDE." /></a>
    THE BRIDE.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>The Proper Time.</b>&mdash;Much has been printed in various
  volumes regarding the time of the year, the influence of the seasons,
  etc., as determining the proper time to set for the wedding day.
  Circumstances must govern these things. To be sure, it is best to avoid
  extremes of heat and cold. Very hot weather is debilitating, and below
  zero is uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>2. <b>The Lady Should Select the Day.</b>&mdash;There is one element
  in the time that is of great importance, physically, especially to the
  lady. It is the day of the month, and it is hoped that every lady who
  contemplates marriage is informed upon the great facts of ovulation. By
  reading page <!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page200"></a>[200]</span>245 she will understand that it is to her
  advantage to select a wedding day about fifteen or eighteen days after
  the close of menstruation in the month chosen, since it is not best that
  the first child should be conceived during the excitement or irritation
  of first attempts at congress; besides modest brides naturally do not
  wish to become large with child before the season of congratulation and
  visiting on their return from the "wedding tour" is over.</p>

  <p>Again, it is asserted by many of the best writers on this subject,
  that the mental condition of either parent at the time of intercourse
  will be stamped upon the embryo; hence it is not only best, but wise,
  that the first-born should not be conceived until several months after
  marriage, when the husband and wife have nicely settled in their new
  home, and become calm in their experience of each other's society.</p>

  <p>3. <b>The "Bridal Tour"</b> is considered by many newly-married
  couples as a necessary introduction to a life of connubial joy. There is,
  in our opinion, nothing in the custom to recommend it. After the
  excitement and overwork before and accompanying a wedding, the period
  immediately following should be one of <i>rest</i>.</p>

  <p>Again, the money expended on the ceremony and a tour of the principal
  cities, etc., might, in most cases, be applied to a multitude of
  after-life comforts of far more lasting value and importance. To be sure,
  it is not pleasant for the bride, should she remain at home, to pass
  through the ordeal of criticism and vulgar comments of acquaintances and
  friends, and hence, to escape this, the young couple feel like getting
  away for a time. Undoubtedly the best plan for the great majority, after
  this most eventful ceremony, is to enter their future home at once, and
  there to remain in comparative privacy until the novelty of the situation
  is worn off.</p>

  <p>4. <b>If the Conventional Tour</b> is taken, the husband should
  remember that his bride cannot stand the same amount of tramping around
  and sight-seeing that he can. The female organs of generation are so
  easily affected by excessive exercise of the limbs which support them,
  that at this critical period it would be a foolish and costly experience
  to drag a lady hurriedly around the country on an extensive and
  protracted round of sight-seeing or visiting. Unless good common-sense is
  displayed in the manner of spending the "honey-moon," it will prove very
  untrue to its name. In many cases it lays the foundation for the wife's
  first and life-long "backache."</p>

<h2>Advice to Newly Married Couples.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

      alt="The honey-moon." title="The honey-moon." /></a>
    THE HONEY-MOON.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>"Be Ye Fruitful and Multiply"</b> is a Bible commandment which
  the children of men habitually obey. However they may disagree on other
  subjects, all are in accord on this; the barbarous, the civilized, the
  high, the low, the fierce, the gentle&mdash;all unite in the desire which
  finds its accomplishment in the reproduction of their kind. Who <!-- Page
  202 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>[202]</span>shall
  quarrel with the Divinely implanted instinct, or declare it to be vulgar
  or unmentionable? It is during the period of the honeymoon that the
  intensity of this desire, coupled with the greatest curiosity, is at its
  height, and the unbridled license often given the passions at this time
  is attended with the most dangerous consequences.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Consummation of Marriage.</b>&mdash;The first time that the
  husband and wife cohabit together after the ceremony has been performed
  is called the consummation of marriage. Many grave errors have been
  committed by people in this, when one or both of the contracting parties
  were not physically or sexually in a condition to carry out the marriage
  relation. A marriage, however, is complete without this in the eyes of
  the law, as it is a maxim taken from the Roman civil statutes that
  consent, not cohabitation, is the binding element in the ceremony. Yet,
  in most States of the U.S., and in some other countries; marriage is
  legally declared void and of no effect where it is not possible to
  consummate the marriage relation. A divorce may be obtained provided the
  injured party begins the suit.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Test of Virginity.</b>&mdash;The consummation of marriage with a
  virgin is not necessarily attended with a flow of blood, and the absence
  of this sign is not the slightest presumption against her former
  chastity. The true test of virginity is modesty void of any disagreeable
  familiarity. A sincere Christian faith is one of the best
  recommendations.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Let Every Man Remember</b> that the legal right of marriage does
  not carry with it the moral right to injure for life the loving companion
  he has chosen. Ignorance may be the cause, but every man before he
  marries should know something of the physiology and the laws of health,
  and we here give some information which is of very great importance to
  every newly-married man.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Sensuality.</b>&mdash;Lust crucifies love. The young sensual
  husband is generally at fault. Passion sways and the duty to bride and
  wife is nor thought of, and so a modest young wife is often actually
  forced and assaulted by the unsympathetic haste of her husband. An
  amorous man in that way soon destroys his own love, and thus is laid the
  foundation for many difficulties that soon develop trouble and disturb
  the happiness of both.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Abuse After Marriage.</b>&mdash;Usually marriage is consummated
  within a day or two after the ceremony, but this is <!-- Page 203
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>[203]</span>gross
  injustice to the bride. In most cases she is nervous, timid, and
  exhausted by the duties of preparation for the wedding, and in no way in
  a condition, either in body or mind, for the vital change which the
  married relation bring upon her. Many a young husband often lays the
  foundation of many diseases of the womb and of the nervous system in
  gratifying his unchecked passions without a proper regard for his wife's
  exhausted condition.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The First Conjugal Approaches</b> are usually painful to the new
  wife, and no enjoyment to her follows. Great caution and kindness should
  be exercised. A young couple rushing together in their animal passion
  soon produce a nervous and irritating condition which ere long brings
  apathy, indifference, if not dislike. True love and a high regard for
  each other will temper passion into moderation.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Were the Above Injunctions Heeded</b> fully and literally it
  would be folly to say more, but this would be omitting all account of the
  bridegroom's new position, the power of his passion, and the timidity of
  the fair creature who is wondering what fate has in store for her
  trembling modesty. To be sure, there are some women who are possessed of
  more forward natures and stronger desires than others. In such cases
  there may be less trouble.</p>

  <p>9. <b>A Common Error.</b>&mdash;The young husband may have read in
  some treatise on physiology that the hymen in a virgin is the great
  obstacle to be overcome. He is apt to conclude that this is all, that
  some force will be needed to break it down, and that therefore an amount
  of urgency even to the degree of inflicting considerable pain is
  justifiable. This is usually wrong. It rarely constitutes any
  obstruction, and, even when its rupturing may be necessary, it alone
  seldom causes suffering.</p>

  <p>There are sometimes certain deformities of the vagina, but no woman
  should knowingly seek matrimonial relations when thus afflicted.</p>

  <p>We quote from Dr. C. A. Huff the following:</p>

  <p>10. <b>"What Is It, then, that Usually Causes</b> distress to many
  women, whether a bride or a long-time wife?" The answer is, Simply those
  conditions of the organs in which they are not properly prepared, by
  anticipation and desire, to receive a foreign body. The modest one craves
  only refined and platonic love at first, and if husbands, new and old,
  would only realize this plain truth, wife-torturing would cease and the
  happiness of each one of all human pairs vastly increase. <!-- Page 204
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>[204]</span></p>

  <p>11. <b>The Conditions of the Female</b> organs depend upon the state
  of the mind just as much as in the case of the husband. The male,
  however, being more sensual, is more quickly roused. She is far less
  often or early ready. In its unexcited state the vagina is lax, its walls
  are closed together, and their surfaces covered by but little lubricating
  secretion. The chaster one of the pair has no desire that this sacred
  vestibule to the great arcana of procreation shall be immediately and
  roughly invaded. This, then, is the time for all approaches by the
  husband to be of the most delicate, considerate, and refined description
  possible. The quietest and softest demeanor, with gentle and re-assuring
  words, are all that should be attempted at first. The wedding day has
  probably been one of fatigue, and it is foolish to go farther.</p>

  <p>12. <b>For More Than One Night</b> it will be wise, indeed, if the
  wife's confidence shall be as much wooed and won by patient, delicate,
  and prolonged courting, as before the marriage engagement. How long
  should this period of waiting be can only be decided by the circumstances
  of any case. The bride will ultimately deny no favor which is sought with
  full deference to her modesty, and in connection with which bestiality is
  not exhibited. Her nature is that of delicacy; her affection is of a
  refined character; if the love and conduct offered to her are a careful
  effort to adapt roughness and strength to her refinement and weakness,
  her admiration and responsive love will be excited to the utmost.</p>

  <p>13. <b>When That Moment Arrives</b> when the bride finds she can
  repose perfect confidence in the kindness of her husband, that his love
  is not purely animal, and that no violence will be attempted, the power
  of her affection for him will surely assert itself; the mind will act on
  those organs which nature has endowed to fulfil the law of her being, the
  walls of the vagina will expand, and the glands at the entrance will be
  fully lubricated by a secretion of mucous which renders congress a matter
  of comparative ease.</p>

  <p>14. <b>When This Responsive Enlargement</b> and lubrication are fully
  realized, it is made plain why the haste and force so common to first and
  subsequent coition is, as it has been justly called, nothing but
  "legalized rape." Young husband! Prove your manhood, not by yielding to
  unbridled lust and cruelty, but by the exhibition of true power in
  <i>self-control</i> and patience with the helpless being confided to your
  care! Prolong the delightful season of courting into and <i>through</i>
  wedded life, and rich shall be your reward. <!-- Page 205 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>[205]</span></p>

  <p>15. <b>A Want of Desire</b> may often prevail, and may be caused by
  loss of sleep, study, constant thought, mental disturbance, anxiety,
  self-abuse, excessive use of tobacco or alcoholic drink, etc. Overwork
  may cause debility; a man may not have an erection for months, yet it may
  not be a sign of debility, sexual lethargy or impotence. Get the mind and
  the physical constitution in proper condition, and most all these
  difficulties will disappear. Good athletic exercise by walking, riding,
  or playing croquet, or any other amusement, will greatly improve the
  condition. A good rest, however, will be necessary to fully restore the
  mind and the body, then the natural condition of the sexual organs will
  be resumed.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Having Twins.</b>&mdash;Having twins is undoubtedly hereditary
  and descends from generation to generation, and persons who have twins
  are generally those who have great sexual vigor. It is generally the
  result of a second cohabitation immediately following the first, but some
  parents have twins who cohabit but once during several days.</p>

  <p>17. <b>Proper Intercourse.</b>&mdash;The right relation of a
  newly-married couple will rather increase than diminish love. To thus
  offer up the maiden on the altar of love and affection only swells her
  flood of joy and bliss; whereas, on the other hand, sensuality humbles,
  debases, pollutes, and never elevates. Young husbands should wait for an
  <i>invitation to the banquet</i>, and they will be amply paid by the very
  pleasure sought. Invitation or permission delights, and possession by
  force degrades. The right-minded bridegroom will postpone the exercise of
  his nuptial rights for a few days, and allow his young wife to become
  rested from the preparation and fatigue of the wedding, and become
  accustomed to the changes in her new relations of life.</p>

  <p>18. <b>Rightly Beginning Sexual Life.</b>&mdash;Intercourse promotes
  all the functions of the body and mind, but rampant lust and sexual
  abuses soon destroy the natural pleasures of intercourse, and unhappiness
  will be the result. Remember that <i>intercourse</i> should not become
  the polluted purpose of marriage. To be sure, rational enjoyment benefits
  and stimulates love, but the pleasure of each other's society, standing
  together on all questions of mutual benefit, working hand in hand and
  shoulder to shoulder in the battle of life, raising a family of beautiful
  children, sharing each other's joys and sorrows, are the things that
  bring to every couple the best, purest, and noblest enjoyment that God
  has bestowed upon man. <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h2>Sexual Proprieties and Improprieties.</h2>

  <p>1. To have offspring is not to be regarded as a luxury, but as a great
  primary necessity of health and happiness, of which every fully-developed
  man and woman should have a fair share, while it cannot be denied that
  the ignorance of the necessity of sexual intercourse to the health and
  virtue of both man and woman is the most fundamental error in medical and
  moral philosophy.</p>

  <p>2. In a state of pure nature, where man would have his sexual
  instincts under full and natural restraint, there would be little, if
  any, licentiousness, and children would be the result of natural desire,
  and not the accidents of lust.</p>

  <p>3. This is an age of sensuality; unnatural passions are cultivated and
  indulged. Young people in the course of their engagement often sow the
  seed of serious excesses. This habit of embracing, sitting on the lover's
  lap, leaning on his breast, long and uninterrupted periods of secluded
  companionship, have become so common that it is amazing how a young lady
  can safely arrive at the wedding day. While this conduct may safely
  terminate with the wedding day, yet it cultivates the tendency which
  often results in excessive indulgencies after the honey-moon is over.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Separate Beds.</b>&mdash;Many writers have vigorously championed
  as a reform the practice of separate beds for husband and wife. While we
  would not recommend such separation, it is no doubt very much better for
  both husband and wife, in case the wife is pregnant. Where people are
  reasonably temperate, no such ordinary precautions as <!-- Page 207
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>[207]</span>separate
  sleeping places may be necessary. But in case of pregnancy it will add
  rest to the mother and add vigor to the unborn child. Sleeping together,
  however, is natural and cultivates true affection, and it is
  physiologically true that in very cold weather life is prolonged by
  husband and wife sleeping together.</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Authority of the Wife.</b>&mdash;Let the wife judge whether
  she desires a separate couch or not. She has the superior right to
  control her own person. In such diseases as consumption, or other severe
  or lingering diseases, separate beds should always be insisted upon.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Time for Indulgence.</b>&mdash;The health of the generative
  functions depends upon exercise, just the same as any other vital organ.
  Intercourse should be absolutely avoided just before or after meals, or
  just after mental excitement or physical exercise. No wife should indulge
  her husband when he is under the influence of alcoholic stimulants, for
  idiocy and other serious maladies are liable to be visited upon the
  offspring.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Restraint during Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;There is no question but
  what moderate indulgence during the first few months of pregnancy does
  not result in serious harm; but people who excessively satisfy their
  ill-governed passions are liable to pay a serious penalty.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Miscarriage.</b>&mdash;If a woman is liable to abortion or
  miscarriage, absolute abstinence is the only remedy. No sexual indulgence
  during pregnancy can be safely tolerated.</p>

  <p>9. It is better for people not to marry until they are of proper age.
  It is a physiological fact that men seldom reach the full maturity of
  their virile power before the age of twenty-five, and the female rarely
  attains the full vigor of her sexual powers before the age of twenty.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Illicit Pleasures.</b>&mdash;The indulgence of illicit
  pleasures, says Dr. S. Pancoast, sooner or later is sure to entail the
  most loathsome diseases on their votaries. Among these diseases are
  Gonorrh&oelig;a, Syphilis, Spermatorrh&oelig;a (waste of semen by daily
  and nightly involuntary emissions), Satyriasis (a species of sexual
  madness, or a sexual diabolism, causing men to commit rape and other
  beastly acts and outrages, not only on women and children, but men and
  animals, as sodomy, pederasty, etc.), Nymphomania (causing women to
  assail every man they meet, and supplicate and excite him to gratify
  their lustful passions, or who resort to means of sexual pollutions,
  which is impossible to describe without shuddering), together with spinal
  diseases and many disorders of the most distressing and disgusting
  character, <!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page208"></a>[208]</span>filling the bones with rottenness, and
  eating away the flesh by gangrenous ulcers, until the patient dies, a
  horrible mass of putridity and corruption.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Sensuality.</b>&mdash;Sensuality is not love, but an unbridled
  desire which kills the soul. Sensuality will drive away the roses in the
  cheeks of womanhood, undermine health and produce a brazen countenance
  that can be read by all men. The harlot may commit her sins in the dark,
  but her countenance reveals her character and her immorality is an open
  secret.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Sexual Temperance.</b>&mdash;All excesses and absurdities of
  every kind should be carefully avoided. Many of the female disorders
  which often revenge themselves in the cessation of all sexual pleasure
  are largely due to the excessive practice of sexual indulgence.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Frequency.</b>&mdash;Some writers claim that intercourse should
  never occur except for the purpose of childbearing; but such restraint is
  not natural and consequently not conducive to health. There are many
  conditions in which the health of the mother and offspring must be
  respected. It is now held that it is nearer a crime than a virtue to
  prostitute woman to the degradation of breeding animals by compelling her
  to bring into life more offspring than can be born healthy, or be
  properly cared for and educated.</p>

  <p>14. In this work we shall attempt to specify no rule, but simply give
  advice as to the health and happiness of both man and wife. A man should
  not gratify his own desires at the expense of his wife's health, comfort
  or inclination. Many men no doubt harass their wives and force many
  burdens upon their slender constitutions. But it is a great sin and no
  true husband will demand unreasonable recognition. The wife when
  physically able, however, should bear with her husband. Man is naturally
  sensitive on this subject, and it takes but little to alienate his
  affections and bring discord into the family.</p>

  <p>15. The best writers lay down the rule for the government of the
  marriage-bed, that sexual indulgence should only occur about once in a
  week or ten days, and this of course applies only to those who enjoy a
  fair degree of health. But it is a hygienic and physiological fact that
  those who indulge only once a month receive a far greater degree of the
  intensity of enjoyment than those who indulge their passions more
  frequently. Much pleasure is lost by excesses where much might be gained
  by temperance, giving rest to the organs for the accumulation of nervous
  force. <!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>1. <b>Continue Your Courtship.</b>&mdash;Like causes produce like
  effects.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Neglect of Your Companion.</b>&mdash;Do not assume a right to
  neglect your companion more after marriage than you did before.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Secrets.</b>&mdash;Have no secrets that you keep from your
  companion. A third party is always disturbing.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Avoid the Appearance of Evil.</b>&mdash;In matrimonial matters
  it is often that the mere appearance contains all the evil. Love, as soon
  as it rises above calculation and becomes love, is exacting. It gives
  all, and demands all.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Once Married, Never Open Your Mind to Any Change.</b>&mdash;If
  you keep the door of your purpose closed, evil or even desirable changes
  cannot make headway without help.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Keep Step in Mental Development.</b>&mdash;A tree that grows for
  forty years may take all the sunlight from a tree that stops growing at
  twenty.</p>

<h2>How to Be a Good Wife.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Reverence Your Husband.</b>&mdash;He sustains by God's order a
  position of dignity as head of a family, head of the woman. Any breaking
  down of this order indicates a mistake in the union, or a digression from
  duty.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Love Him.</b>&mdash;A wife loves as naturally as the sun shines.
  Love is your best weapon. You conquered him with that in the first place.
  You can reconquer by the same means.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Do Not Conceal Your Love from Him.</b>&mdash;If he is crowded
  with care, and too busy to seem to heed your love, you need to give all
  the greater attention to securing his knowledge of your love. If you
  intermit he will settle down into a hard, cold life with increased
  rapidity. Your example will keep the light on his conviction. The more he
  neglects the fire on the hearth, the more carefully must you feed and
  guard it. It must not be allowed to go out. Once out you must sit ever in
  darkness and in the cold.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Cultivate the Modesty and Delicacy of Your Youth.</b>&mdash;The
  relations and familiarity of wedded life may seem to tone down the
  sensitive and retiring instincts of girlhood, but nothing can compensate
  for the loss of these. However, much men may admire the public
  performance of gifted women, they do not desire that boldness and dash in
  a wife. The holy blush of a maiden's modesty is more powerful in
  hallowing and governing a home than the heaviest armament that ever a
  warrior bore.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Cultivate Personal Attractiveness.</b>&mdash;This means the
  storing of your mind with a knowledge of passing events, and with a good
  idea of the world's general advance. If you read nothing, and make no
  effort to make yourself attractive, you will soon sink down into a dull
  hack of stupidity. If <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page211"></a>[211]</span>your husband never hears from you any
  words of wisdom, or of common information, he will soon hear nothing from
  you. Dress and gossips soon wear out. If your memory is weak, so that it
  hardly seems worth while to read, that is additional reason for
  reading.</p>

      alt="Talking before marriage." title="Talking before marriage." /></a>
    TALKING BEFORE MARRIAGE.
  </div>
  <p>6. <b>Cultivate Physical Attractiveness.</b>&mdash;When you were
  encouraging the attentions of him whom you now call husband, you did not
  neglect any item of dress or appearance <!-- Page 212 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>[212]</span>that could help you.
  Your hair was always in perfect training. You never greeted him with a
  ragged or untidy dress or soiled hands. It is true that your "market is
  made," but you cannot afford to have it "broken." Cleanliness and good
  taste will attract now as they did formerly. Keep yourself at your best.
  Make the most of physical endowments. Neatness and order break the power
  of poverty.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Study Your Husband's Character.</b>&mdash;He has his
  peculiarities. He has no right to many of them, and you need to know
  them; thus you can avoid many hours of friction. The good pilot steers
  around the sunken rocks that lie in the channel. The engineer may remove
  them, not the pilot. You are more pilot than engineer. Consult his
  tastes. It is more important to your home, that you should please him
  than anybody else.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Practice Economy.</b>&mdash;Many families are cast out of peace
  into grumbling and discord by being compelled to fight against poverty.
  When there are no great distresses to be endured or accounted for,
  complaint and fault-finding are not so often evoked. Keep your husband
  free from the annoyance of disappointed creditors, and he will be more
  apt to keep free from annoying you. To toil hard for bread, to fight the
  wolf from the door, to resist impatient creditors, to struggle against
  complaining pride at home, is too much to ask of one man. A crust that is
  your own is a feast, while a feast that is purloined from unwilling
  creditors is a famine.</p>

<h2>How to Be a Good Husband.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Show Your Love.</b>&mdash;All life manifests itself. As
  certainly as a live tree will put forth leaves in the spring, so
  certainly will a living love show itself. Many a noble man toils early
  and late to earn bread and position for his wife. He hesitates at no
  weariness for her sake. He justly thinks that such industry and
  providence give a better expression of his love than he could by
  caressing her and letting the grocery bills go unpaid. He fills the
  cellar and pantry. He drives and pushes his business. He never dreams
  that he is actually starving his wife to death. He may soon have a woman
  left to superintend his home, but his wife is dying. She must be kept
  alive by the same process that called her into being. Recall and repeat
  the little attentions and delicate compliments that once made you so
  agreeable, and that fanned her love into a consuming flame. It is not
  beneath the dignity of the skillful physician to study all the <!-- Page
  214 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>[214]</span>little
  symptoms, and order all the little round of attentions that check the
  waste of strength and brace the staggering constitution. It is good work
  for a husband to cherish his wife.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

      alt="Talking after marriage." title="Talking after marriage." /></a>
    TALKING AFTER MARRIAGE.
  </div>
  <p>2. <b>Consult with Your Wife.</b>&mdash;She is apt to be as right as
  you are, and frequently able to add much to your stock of wisdom. In any
  event she appreciates your attentions.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Study to Keep Her Young.</b>&mdash;It can be done. It is not
  work, but worry, that wears. Keep a brave, true heart between her and all
  harm.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Help to Bear Her Burdens.</b>&mdash;Bear one another's burdens,
  and so fulfill the law of love. Love seeks opportunities to do for the
  loved object. She has the constant care of your children. She is ordained
  by the Lord to stand guard over them. Not a disease can appear in the
  community without her taking the alarm. Not a disease can come over the
  threshold without her instantly springing into the mortal combat. If
  there is a deficiency anywhere, it comes out of her pleasure. Her burdens
  are everywhere. Look for them, that you may lighten them.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Make Yourself Helpful by Thoughtfulness.</b>&mdash;Remember to
  bring into the house your best smile and sunshine. It is good for you,
  and it cheers up the home. There is hardly a nook in the house that has
  not been carefully hunted through to drive out everything that might
  annoy you. The dinner which suits, or ought to suit you, has not come on
  the table of itself. It represents much thoughtfulness and work. You can
  do no more manly thing than find some way of expressing, in word or look,
  your appreciation of it.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Express Your Will, Not by Commands, but by
  Suggestions.</b>&mdash;It is God's order that you should be the head of
  the family. You are clothed with authority. But this does not authorize
  you to be stern and harsh, as an officer in the army. Your authority is
  the dignity of love. When it is not clothed in love it ceases to have the
  substance of authority. A simple suggestion that may embody a wish, an
  opinion or an argument, becomes one who reigns over such a kingdom as
  yours.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Seek to Refine Your Nature.</b>&mdash;It is no slander to say
  that many men have wives much more refined than themselves. This is
  natural in the inequalities of life. Other qualities may compensate for
  any defect here. But you need have no defect in refinement. Preserve the
  gentleness and refinement of your wife as a rich legacy for your
  children, and in so doing you will lift yourself to higher levels. <!--
  Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>[215]</span></p>

  <p>8. <b>Be a Gentleman as well as a Husband.</b>&mdash;The signs and
  bronze and callouses of toil are no indications that you are not a
  gentleman. The soul of gentlemanliness is a kindly feeling toward others,
  that prompts one to secure their comfort. That is why the thoughtful
  peasant lover is always so gentlemanly, and in his love much above
  himself.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Stay at Home.</b>&mdash;Habitual absence during the evenings is
  sure to bring sorrow. If your duty or business calls you, you have the
  promise that you will be kept in all your ways. But if you go out to
  mingle with other society, and leave your wife at home alone, or with the
  children and servants, know that there is no good in store for you. She
  has claims upon you that you can not afford to allow to go to protest.
  Reverse the case. You sit down alone after having waited all day for your
  wife's return, and think of her as reveling in gay society, and see if
  you can keep out all the doubts as to what takes her away. If your home
  is not as attractive as you want it, you are a principal partner. Set
  yourself about the work of making it attractive.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Take Your Wife with You into Society.</b>&mdash;Seclusion
  begets morbidness. She needs some of the life that comes from contact
  with society. She must see how other people appear and act. It often
  requires an exertion for her to go out of her home, but it is good for
  her and for you. She will bring back more sunshine. It is wise to rest
  sometimes. When the Arab stops for his dinner he unpacks his camel. Treat
  your wife with as much consideration.</p>

    TIRED OF LIFE.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Much Better to Be Alone.</b>&mdash;He who made man said it is
  not good for him to be alone; but it is much better to be alone, than it
  is to be in some kinds of company. Many couples who felt unhappy when
  they were apart, have been utterly miserable when together; and scores
  who have been ready to go through fire and water to get married, have
  been willing to run the risk of fire and brimstone to get divorced. It is
  by no means certain that because persons are wretched before marriage
  they will be happy after it. The wretchedness of many homes, and the
  prevalence of immorality and divorce is a sad commentary on the evils
  which result from unwise marriages.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Unavoidable Evils.</b>&mdash;There are plenty of unavoidable
  evils in this world, and it is mournful to think of the multitudes who
  are preparing themselves for needless disappointments, and who yet have
  no fear, and are unwilling to be instructed, cautioned or warned. To them
  the experience of mature life is of little account compared with the
  wisdom of ardent and enthusiastic youth.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Matrimonial Infelicity.</b>&mdash;One great cause of matrimonial
  infelicity is the hasty marriages of persons who have no adequate
  knowledge of each other's characters. Two strangers become acquainted,
  and are attracted to each other, and without taking half the trouble to
  investigate or inquire that a prudent man would take before buying a
  saddle horse, they are married. In a few weeks or months it is perhaps
  found that one of the parties was married already, or possibly that the
  man is drunken or vicious, or the woman anything but what she should be.
  Then begins the bitter part of the experience: shame, disgrace, scandal,
  separation, sin and divorce, all come as the natural results of a rash
  and foolish marriage. A little time spent in honest, candid, and careful
  preliminary inquiry and investigation, would have saved the trouble.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Climax.</b>&mdash;It has been said that a man is never
  utterly ruined until he has married a bad woman. So the climax of woman's
  miseries and sorrows may be said to come only when she is bound with that
  bond which should be her chiefest blessing and her highest joy, but which
  may prove her deepest sorrow and her bitterest curse.</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Folly of Follies.</b>&mdash;There are some lessons which
  people are very slow to learn, and yet which are based upon <!-- Page 218
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>[218]</span>the simple
  principles of common-sense. A young lady casts her eye upon a young man.
  She says, "I mean to have that man." She plies her arts, engages his
  affections, marries him, and secures for herself a life of sorrow and
  disappointment, ending perhaps in a broken up home or an early grave. Any
  prudent, intelligent person of mature age, might have warned or cautioned
  her; but she sought no advice, and accepted no admonition. A young man
  may pursue a similar course with equally disastrous results.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Hap-Hazard.</b>&mdash;Many marriages are undoubtedly arranged by
  what may be termed the accident of locality. Persons live near each
  other, become acquainted, and engage themselves to those whom they never
  would have selected as their companions in life if they had wider
  opportunities of acquaintance. Within the borders of their limited circle
  they make a selection which may be wise or may be unwise. They have no
  means of judging, they allow no one else to judge for them. The results
  are sometimes happy and sometimes unhappy in the extreme. It is well to
  act cautiously in doing what can be done but once. It is not a pleasant
  experience for a person to find out a mistake when it is too late to
  rectify it.</p>

  <p>7. <b>We All Change.</b>&mdash;When two persons of opposite sex are
  often thrown together they are very naturally attracted to each other,
  and are liable to imbibe the opinion that they are better fitted for
  life-long companionship than any other two persons in the world. This may
  be the case, or it may not be. There are a thousand chances against such
  a conclusion to one in favor of it. But even if at the present moment
  these two persons were fitted to be associated, no one can tell whether
  the case will be the same five or ten years hence. Men change; women
  change; they are not the same they were ten years ago; they are not the
  same they will be ten years hence.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Safe Rule.</b>&mdash;Do not be in a hurry; take your time,
  and consider well before you allow your devotion to rule you. Study first
  your character, then study the character of her whom you desire to marry.
  Love works mysteriously, and if it will bear careful and cool
  investigation, it will no doubt thrive under adversity. When people marry
  they unite their destinies for the better or the worse. Marriage is a
  contract for life and will never bear a hasty conclusion. <i>Never be in
  a hurry!</i></p>

      <p>The meat it feeds on.&mdash;<span class="sc">Shakespeare</span>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<hr class="short" >

  <p>1. <b>Definition.</b>&mdash;Jealousy is an accidental passion, for
  which the faculty indeed is unborn. In its nobler form and in its nobler
  motives it arises from love, and in its lower form it arises from the
  deepest and darkest Pit of Satan.</p>

  <p>2. <b>How Developed.</b>&mdash;Jealousy arises either from weakness,
  which from a sense of its own want of lovable qualities is not convinced
  of being sure of its cause, or from distrust, which thinks the beloved
  person capable of infidelity. Sometimes all these motives may act
  together.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Noblest Jealousy.</b>&mdash;The noblest jealousy, if the term
  noble is appropriate, is a sort of ambition or pride of the loving person
  who feels it is an insult that another one should assume it as possible
  to supplant his love, or it is the highest degree of devotion which sees
  a declaration of its object in the foreign invasion, as it were, of his
  own altar. Jealousy is always a sign that a little more wisdom might
  adorn the individual without harm.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Lowest Jealousy.</b>&mdash;The lowest species of jealousy is
  a sort of avarice of envy which, without being capable of love, at least
  wishes to possess the object of its jealousy alone by the one party
  assuming a sort of property right over the other. This jealousy, which
  might be called the Satanic, is generally to be found with old withered
  "husbands," whom the devil has prompted to marry young women and who
  forthwith dream night and day of cuck-old's horns. These Argus-eyed
  keepers are no longer capable of any feeling that could be called love,
  they are rather as a rule heartless house-tyrants, and are in constant
  dread that some one may admire or appreciate his unfortunate slave.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Want of Love.</b>&mdash;The general conclusion will be that
  jealousy is more the result of wrong conditions which cause uncongenial
  unions, and which through moral corruption, artificially create distrust,
  than a necessary accompaniment of love.</p>

    SEEKING THE LIFE OF A RIVAL.
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>[221]</span></p>

  <p>6. <b>Result of Poor Opinion.</b>&mdash;Jealousy is a passion with
  which those are most afflicted who are the least worthy of love. An
  innocent maiden who enters marriage will not dream of getting jealous;
  but all her innocence cannot secure her against the jealousy of her
  husband if he has been a libertine. Those are wont to be the most jealous
  who have the consciousness that they themselves are most deserving of
  jealousy. Most men in consequence of their present education and
  corruption have so poor an opinion not only of the male, but even of the
  female sex, that they believe every woman at every moment capable of what
  they themselves have looked for among all and have found among the most
  unfortunate, the prostitutes. No libertine can believe in the purity of
  woman; it is contrary to nature. A libertine therefore cannot believe in
  the loyalty of a faithful wife.</p>

  <p>7. <b>When Justifiable.</b>&mdash;There may be occasions where
  jealousy is justifiable. If a woman's confidence has been shaken in her
  husband, or a husband's confidence has been shaken in his wife by certain
  signs or conduct, which have no other meaning but that of infidelity,
  then there is just cause for jealousy. There must, however, be certain
  proof as evidence of the wife's or husband's immoral conduct.
  Imaginations or any foolish absurdities should have no consideration
  whatever, and let everyone have confidence until his or her faith has
  been shaken by the revelation of absolute facts.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Caution and Advice.</b>&mdash;No couple should allow their
  associations to develop into an engagement and marriage if either one has
  any inclination to jealousy. It shows invariably a want of sufficient
  confidence, and that want of confidence, instead of being diminished
  after marriage, is liable to increase, until by the aid of the
  imagination and wrong interpretation the home is made a hell and divorce
  a necessity. Let it be remembered, there can be no true love without
  perfect and absolute confidence. Jealousy is always the sign of weakness
  or madness. Avoid a jealous disposition, for it is an open acknowledgment

    The Mother's Good Night Prayer.

  <p>1. <b>The Right Way.</b>&mdash;When mankind will properly love and
  marry and then rightly generate, carry, nurse and educate their children,
  will they in deed and in truth carry out <!-- Page 223 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>[223]</span>the holy and happy
  purpose of their Creator. See those miserable and depraved scape-goats of
  humanity, the demented simpletons, the half-crazy, unbalanced multitudes
  which infest our earth, and fill our prisons with criminals and our
  poor-houses with paupers. Oh! the boundless capabilities and perfections
  of our God-like nature and, alas! its deformities! All is the result of
  the ignorance or indifference of parents. As long as children are the
  accidents of lust instead of the premeditated objects of love, so long
  will the offspring deteriorate and the world be cursed with deformities,
  monstrosities, unhumanities and cranks.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Each After Its Kind.</b>&mdash;"Like parents like children." "In
  their own image beget" they them. In what other can they? "How can a
  corrupt tree bring forth good fruit?" How can animal propensities in
  parents generate other than depraved children, or moral purity beget
  beings other than as holy by nature as those at whose hands they received
  existence and constitution?</p>

  <p>3. <b>As Are the Parents</b>, physically, mentally and morally when
  they stamp their own image and likeness upon progeny, so will be the
  constitution of that progeny.</p>

  <p>4. <b>"Just as the Twig Is Bent the Tree's Inclined."</b>&mdash;Yet
  the bramble cannot be bent to bear delicious peaches, nor the sycamore to
  bear grain. Education is something, but <i>parentage</i> is
  <i>everything</i>; because it "<i>dyes in the wool</i>," and thereby
  exerts an influence on character almost infinitely more powerful than all
  other conditions put together.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Healthy and Beautiful Children.</b>&mdash;Thoughtless mortal!
  Before you allow the first goings forth of love, learn what the parental
  conditions in you mean, and you will confer a great boon upon the
  prospective bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh! If it is in your
  power to be the parent of beautiful, healthy, moral and talented children
  instead of diseased and depraved, is it not your imperious duty then, to
  impart to them that physical power, moral perfection, and intellectual
  capability, which shall ennoble their lives and make them good people and
  good citizens?</p>

  <p>6. <b>Pause and Tremble.</b>&mdash;Prospective parents! Will you
  trifle with the dearest interests of your children? Will you in matters
  thus momentous, head-long rush</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Where angels dare not tread?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Seeking only mere animal indulgence?&mdash;Well might cherubim shrink
  from assuming responsibilities thus momentous! Yet, how many parents
  tread this holy ground completely unprepared, and almost as thoughtlessly
  and ignorantly as brutes&mdash;entailing even loathsome diseases and <!--
  Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page224"></a>[224]</span>sensual propensities upon the fruit of
  their own bodies. Whereas they are bound, by obligations the most
  imperious, to bestow on them a good physical organization, along with a
  pure, moral, and strong intellectual constitution, or else not to become
  parents! Especially since it is easier to generate human angels than
  devils incarnate.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Hereditary Descent.</b>&mdash;This great law of things,
  "Hereditary Descent," fully proves and illustrates in any required number
  and variety of cases, showing that progeny inherits the constitutional
  natures and characters, mental and physical, of parents, including
  pre-dispositions to consumption, insanity, all sorts of disease, etc., as
  well as longevity, strength, stature, looks, disposition,
  talents,&mdash;all that is constitutional. From what other source do or
  can they come? Indeed, who can doubt a truth as palpable as that children
  inherit some, and if some, therefore all, the physical and mental nature
  and constitution of parents, thus becoming almost their fac-similes?</p>

  <p>8. <b>Illustrations.</b>&mdash;A whaleman was severely hurt by a
  harpooned and desperate whale turning upon the small boat, and, by his
  monstrous jaws, smashing it to pieces, one of which, striking him in his
  right side, crippled him for life. When sufficiently recovered, he
  married, according to previous engagement, and his daughter, born in due
  time, and closely resembling him in looks, constitution and character,
  has a weak and sore place corresponding in location with that of the
  injury of her father. Tubercles have been found in the lungs of infants
  at birth, born of consumptive parents,&mdash;a proof, clear and
  demonstrative, that children inherit the several states of parental
  physiology existing at the time they received their physiological
  constitution. The same is true of the transmission of those diseases
  consequent on the violation of the law of chastity, and the same
  conclusion established thereby.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Parent's Participation.</b>&mdash;Each parent furnishing an
  indispensable portion of the materials of life, and somehow or other,
  contributes parentally to the formation of the constitutional character
  of their joint product, appears far more reasonable, than to ascribe, as
  many do, the whole to either, some to paternity, others to maternity.
  Still this decision go which way it may, does not affect the great fact
  that children inherit both the physiology and the mentality existing in
  parents at the time they received being and constitution.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Illegitimates or Bastards</b> also furnish strong proof of the
  correctness of this our leading doctrine. They are generally lively,
  sprightly, witty, frolicsome, knowing, <!-- Page 225 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>[225]</span>quick of perception,
  apt to learn, full of passion, quick-tempered, impulsive throughout,
  hasty, indiscreet, given to excesses, yet abound in good feeling, and are
  well calculated to enjoy life, though in general sadly deficient in some
  essential moral elements.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Character of Illegitimates.</b>&mdash;Wherein, then, consists
  this difference? First, in "novelty lending an enchantment" rarely
  experienced in sated wedlock, as well as in power of passion sufficient
  to break through all restraint, external and internal; and hence their
  high wrought organization. They are usually wary and on the alert, and
  their parents drank "stolen waters." They are commonly wanting in moral
  balance, or else delinquent in some important moral aspect; nor would
  they have ever been born unless this had been the case, for the time
  being at least, with their parents. Behold in these, and many other
  respects easily cited, how striking the coincidence between their
  characters on the one hand, and, on the other, those parental conditions
  necessarily attendant on their origin.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Children's Condition</b> depends upon parents' condition at the
  time of the sexual embrace. Let parents recall, as nearly as may be their
  circumstances and states of body and mind at this period, and place them
  by the side of the physical and mental constitutions of their children,
  and then say whether this law is not a great practical truth, and if so,
  its importance is as the happiness and misery it is capable of affecting!
  The application of this mighty engine of good or evil to mankind, to the
  promotion of human advancement, is the great question which should
  profoundly interest all parents.</p>

  <p>13. <b>The Vital Period.</b>&mdash;The physical condition of parents
  at the vital period of transmission of life should be a perfect condition
  of health in both body and mind, and a rigorous condition of all the
  animal organs and functions.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Muscular Preparation.</b>&mdash;Especially should parents
  cultivate their muscular system preparatory to the perfection of this
  function, and of their children; because, to impart strength and stamina
  to offspring they must of necessity both possess a good muscular
  organization, and also bring it into vigorous requisition at this period.
  For this reason, if for no other, let those of sedentary habits cultivate
  muscular energy preparatory to this time of need.</p>

  <p>15. <b>The Seed.</b>&mdash;So exceedingly delicate are the seeds of
  life, that, unless planted in a place of perfect security, they must all
  be destroyed, and our race itself extinguished. And what place is as
  secure as that chosen, where they can <!-- Page 226 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>[226]</span>be reached only with
  the utmost difficulty, and than only at the peril of even life itself?
  Imperfect seed sown in poor ground means a sickly harvest.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Healthy People&mdash;Most Children.</b>&mdash;The most healthy
  classes have the most numerous families; but that, as luxury enervates
  society, it diminishes the population, by enfeebling parents, nature
  preferring none rather than those too weakly to live and be happy, and
  thereby rendering that union unfruitful which is too feeble to produce
  offspring sufficiently strong to enjoy life. Debility and disease often
  cause barrenness. Nature seems to rebel against sickly offspring.</p>

  <p>17. <b>Why Children Die.</b>&mdash;Inquire whether one or both the
  parents of those numerous children that die around us, have not weak
  lungs, or a debilitated stomach, or a diseased liver, or feeble muscles,
  or else use them but little, or disordered nerves, or some other debility
  or form of disease. The prevalence of summer complaints, colic, cholera
  infantum, and other affections of these vital organs of children is truly
  alarming, sweeping them into their graves by the million. Shall other
  animals rear nearly all their young, and shall man, constitutionally by
  far the strongest of them all, lose half or more of his? Is this the
  order of nature? No, but their death-worm is born in and with them, and
  by parental agency.</p>

  <p>18. <b>Grave-Yard Statistics.</b>&mdash;Take grave-yard statistics in
  August, and then say, whether most of the deaths of children are not
  caused by indigestion, or feebleness of the bowels, liver, etc., or
  complaints growing out of them? Rather, take family statistics from
  broken-hearted parents! And yet, in general, those very parents who thus
  suffer more than words can tell, were the first and main transgressors,
  because they entailed those dyspeptic, heart, and other kindred
  affections so common among American parents upon their own children, and
  thereby almost as bad as killed them by inches; thus depriving them of
  the joys of life, and themselves of their greatest earthly treasure!</p>

  <p>19. <b>All Children May Die.</b>&mdash;Children may indeed die whose
  parents are healthy, but they almost must whose parents are essentially
  ailing in one or more of their vital organs; because, since they inherit
  this organ debilitated or diseased, any additional cause of sickness
  attacks this part first, and when it gives out, all go by the board
  together.</p>

  <p>20. <b>Parents Must Learn and Obey.</b>&mdash;How infinitely more
  virtuous and happy would your children be if you should be healthy in
  body, and happy in mind, so as to beget in <!-- Page 227 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>[227]</span>them a constitutionally
  healthy and vigorous physiology, along with a serene and happy frame of
  mind! Words are utterly powerless in answer, and so is everything but a
  lifetime of consequent happiness or misery! Learn and obey, then, the
  laws of life and health, that you may both reap the rich reward yourself,
  and also shower down upon your children after you, blessings many and
  most exalted. Avoid excesses of all kinds, be temperate, take good care
  of the body and avoid exposures and disease, and your children will be
  models of health and beauty.</p>

  <p>21. <b>The Right Condition.</b>&mdash;The great practical inference
  is, that those parents who desire intellectual and moral children, must
  love each other; because, this love, besides perpetually calling forth
  and cultivating their higher faculties, awakens them to the highest pitch
  of exalted action in that climax, concentration, and consummation of love
  which propagates their existing qualities, the mental endowment of
  offspring being proportionate to the purity and intensity of parental
  love.</p>

  <p>22. <b>The Effects.</b>&mdash;The children of affectionate parents
  receive existence and constitution when love has rendered the mentality
  of their parents both more elevated and more active than it is by nature,
  of course the children of loving parents are both more intellectual and
  moral by nature than their parents. Now, if these children and their
  companions also love one another, this same law which renders the second
  generation better than the first, will of course render the third still
  better than the second, and thus of all succeeding generations.</p>

  <p>23. <b>Animal Impulse.</b>&mdash;You may preach and pray till
  doomsday&mdash;may send out missionaries, may circulate tracts and
  Bibles, and multiply revivals and all the means of grace, with little
  avail; because, as long as mankind go on, as now, to propagate by animal
  impulse, so long must their offspring be animal, sensual, devilish! But
  only induce parents cordially to love each other, and you thereby render
  their children constitutionally talented and virtuous. Oh! parents, by as
  much as you prefer the luxuries of concord to the torments of discord,
  and children that are sweet dispositioned and highly intellectual to
  those that are rough, wrathful, and depraved, be entreated to "<i>love
  one another</i>."</p>

    JUST HOME FROM SCHOOL.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Lessening Pauperism.</b>&mdash;Many of the agencies for
  lessening pauperism are afraid of tracing back its growth to the
  frequency of births under wretched conditions. One begins to question
  whether after all sweet charity or dignified philanthropy has not acted
  with an unwise reticence. Among the problems which defy practical
  handling this is the most complicated. The pauperism which arises from
  marriage is the result of the worst elements of character legalized. In
  America, where the boundaries of wedlock are practically boundless, it is
  not desirable, even were it possible, that the state should regulate
  marriage much further than it now does; therefore must the sociologist
  turn for aid to society in his struggle with pauperism.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Right Physical and Spiritual Conditions of
  Birth.</b>&mdash;Society should insist upon the right spiritual and
  physical conditions for birth. It should be considered more than "a pity"
  when another child is born into a home too poor to receive it. The
  underlying selfishness of such an event should be recognized, for it
  brings motherhood under wrong conditions of health and money. Instead of
  each birth being the result of mature consideration and hallowed love,
  children are too often born as animals are born. To be sure the child has
  a father whom he can call by name. Better that there had never been a
  child.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Wrong Results.</b>&mdash;No one hesitates to declare that it is
  want of self-respect and morality which brings wrong results outside of
  marriage, but it is also the want of them which begets evil inside the
  marriage relation. Though there is nothing more difficult than to find
  the equilibrium between self-respect and self-sacrifice, yet on success
  in finding it depends individual and national preservation. The fact of
  being wife and mother or husband and father should imply dignity and
  joyousness, no matter how humble the home.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Difference of Opinion amongst Physicians.</b>&mdash;In regard to
  teaching, the difficulties are great. As soon as one advances beyond the
  simplest subjects of hygiene, one is met with the difference of opinions
  among physicians. When each one has a different way of making a mustard
  plaster, no wonder that each has his own notions about everything else.
  One doctor recommends frequent births, another advises against them.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Different Natures.</b>&mdash;If physiological facts are taught
  to a large class, there are sure to be some in it whose impressionable
  natures are excited by too much plain <!-- Page 230 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>[230]</span>speaking, while there
  are others who need the most open teaching in order to gain any benefit.
  Talks to a few persons generally are wiser than popular lectures.
  Especially are talks needed by mothers and unmothered girls who come from
  everywhere to the city.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Boys and Young Men.</b>&mdash;It is not women alone who require
  the shelter of organizations and instruction, but boys and young men.
  There is no double standard of morality, though the methods of advocating
  it depend upon the sex which is to be instructed. Men are more concerned
  with the practical basis of morality than with its sentiment, and with
  the pecuniary aspects of domestic life than with its physical and mental
  suffering. We all may need medicine for moral ills, yet the very
  intangibleness of purity makes us slow to formulate rules for its growth.
  Under the guidance of the wise in spirit and knowledge, much can be done
  to create a higher standard of marriage and to proportion the number of
  births according to the health and income of parents.</p>

  <p>7. <b>For the Sake of the State.</b>&mdash;If the home exists
  primarily for the sake of the individual, it exists secondarily for the
  sake of the state. Therefore, any home into which are continually born
  the inefficient children of inefficient parents, not only is a discomfort
  in itself, but it also furnishes members for the armies of the
  unemployed, which are tinkering and hindering legislation and demanding
  by the brute force of numbers that the state shall support them.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Opinions From High Authorities.</b>&mdash;In the statements and
  arguments made in the above we have not relied upon our own opinions and
  convictions, but have consulted the best authorities, and we hereby quote
  some of the highest authorities upon this subject.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Rev. Leonard Dawson.</b>&mdash;"How rapidly conjugal prudence
  might lift a nation out of pauperism was seen in France.&mdash;Let them
  therefore hold the maxim that the production of offspring with
  forethought and providence is rational nature. It was immoral to bring
  children into the world whom they could not reasonably hope to feed,
  clothe and educate."</p>

  <p>10. <b>Mrs. Fawcett.</b>&mdash;"Nothing will permanently offset
  pauperism while the present reckless increase of population
  continues."</p>

  <p>11. <b>Dr. George Napheys.</b>&mdash;"Having too many children
  unquestionably has its disastrous effects on both mother and <!-- Page
  231 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>[231]</span>children
  as known to every intelligent physician. Two-thirds of all cases of womb
  disease, says Dr. Tilt, are traceable to child-bearing in feeble women.
  There are also women to whom pregnancy is a nine months' torture, and
  others to whom it is nearly certain to prove fatal. Such a condition
  cannot be discovered before marriage&mdash;The detestable crime of
  abortion is appallingly rife in our day. It is abroad in our land to an
  extent which would have shocked the dissolute women of pagan
  Rome&mdash;This wholesale, fashionable murder, how are we to stop it?
  Hundreds of vile men and women in our large cities subsist by this
  slaughter of the innocent."</p>

  <p>12. <b>Rev. H. R. Haweis.</b>&mdash;"Until it is thought a disgrace in
  every rank of society, from top to bottom of social scale, to bring into
  the world more children than you are able to provide for, the poor man's
  home, at least, must often be a purgatory&mdash;his children dinnerless,
  his wife a beggar&mdash;himself too often drunk&mdash;here, then, are the
  real remedies: first, control the family growth according to the family
  means of support."</p>

  <p>13. <b>Montague Cookson.</b>&mdash;"The limitation of the number of
  the family&mdash;is as much the duty of married persons as the observance
  of chastity is the duty of those that are unmarried."</p>

  <p>14. <b>John Stuart Mill.</b>&mdash;"Every one has aright to live. We
  will suppose this granted. But no one has a right to bring children into
  life to be supported by other people. Whoever means to stand upon the
  first of these rights must renounce all pretension to the last. Little
  improvement can be expected in morality until the production of a large
  family is regarded in the same light as drunkenness or any other physical
  excess."</p>

  <p>15. <b>Dr. T. D. Nicholls.</b>&mdash;"In the present social state, men
  and women should refrain from having children unless they see a
  reasonable prospect of giving them suitable nurture and education."</p>

  <p>16. <b>Rev. M. J. Savage.</b>&mdash;"Some means ought to be provided
  for checking the birth of sickly children."</p>

  <p>17. <b>Dr. Stockham.</b>&mdash;"Thoughtful minds must acknowledge the
  great wrong done when children are begotten under adverse conditions.
  Women must learn the laws of life so as to protect themselves, and not be
  the means of bringing sin-cursed, diseased children into the world. The
  remedy is in the prevention of pregnancy, not in producing abortion."</p>

<h2>Small Families and the Improvement
of the Race.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Married People Must Decide for Themselves.</b>&mdash;It is the
  fashion of those who marry nowadays to have few children, often none. Of
  course this is a matter which married people must decide for themselves.
  As is stated in an earlier chapter, sometimes this policy is the wisest
  that can be pursued.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs233.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/233.jpg"
      alt="Nurse and child." title="Nurse and child." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>2. <b>Diseased People.</b>&mdash;Diseased people who are likely to
  beget only a sickly offspring, may follow this course, and so may
  thieves, rascals, vagabonds, insane and drunken persons, and all those
  who are likely to bring into the world beings that ought not to be here.
  But why so many well-to-do folks should pursue a policy adapted only to
  paupers and criminals, is not easy to explain. Why marry at all if not to
  found a family that shall live to bless and make glad the earth after
  father and mother are gone? It is not wise to rear too many children, nor
  is it wise to have too few. Properly brought up, they will make home a
  delight and parents happy.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Population Limited.</b>&mdash;Galton, in his great work on
  hereditary genius, observes that "the time may hereafter arrive in far
  distant years, when the population of this earth shall be kept as
  strictly within bounds of number and suitability of race, as the sheep of
  a well-ordered moor, or the plants in an orchard-house; in the meantime,
  let us do what we can to encourage the multiplication of the races best
  <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page233"></a>[233]</span>fitted to invent and conform to a high and
  generous civilization."</p>

  <p>4. <b>Shall Sickly People Raise Children?</b>&mdash;The question
  whether sickly people should marry and propagate their kind, is briefly
  alluded to in an early chapter of this work. Where father and mother are
  both consumptive the chances are that the children will inherit physical
  weakness, which will result in the same disease, unless great pains are
  taken to give them a good physical education, and even then the
  probabilities are that they will find life a burden hardly worth
  living.</p>

  <p>5. <b>No Real Blessing.</b>&mdash;Where one parent is consumptive and
  the other vigorous, the chances are just half as great. If there is a
  scrofulous or consumptive taint in the blood, beware! Sickly children are
  no comfort to their parents, no real blessing. If such people marry, they
  had better, in most cases, avoid parentage.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Welfare of Mankind.</b>&mdash;The advancement of the welfare of
  mankind is a most intricate problem: all ought to refrain from marriage
  who cannot avoid abject poverty for their children; for poverty is not
  only a great evil, but tends to its own increase by leading to
  recklessness in marriage. On the other hand, as Mr. Galton has remarked,
  if the prudent avoid marriage, while the reckless marry, the inferior
  members will tend to supplant the better members of society.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Preventives.</b>&mdash;Remember that the thousands of
  preventives which are advertised in papers, private circulars, etc., are
  not only inefficient, unreliable and worthless, but positively dangerous,
  and the annual mortality of females in this country from this cause alone
  is truly horrifying. Study nature, and nature's laws alone will guide you
  safely in the path of health and happiness.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Nature's Remedy.</b>&mdash;Nature in her wise economy has
  prepared for overproduction, for during the period of pregnancy and
  nursing, and also most of the last half of each menstrual month, woman is
  naturally sterile; but this condition may become irregular and uncertain
  on account of stimulating drinks or immoral excesses.</p>

      alt="The male generative organs." title="The male generative organs." /></a>
  </div>
<h3>THE MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS AND THEIR
STRUCTURE AND ADAPTATION.</h3>

  <p>1. The reproductive organs in man are the penis and testicles and
  their appendages.</p>

  <p>2. The penis deposits the seminal life germ of the male. It is
  designed to fulfill the seed planting mission of human life.</p>

  <p>3. In the accompanying illustration all the parts are named.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Urethra.</b>&mdash;The urethra performs the important mission of
  emptying the bladder, and is rendered very much larger by the passion,
  and the semen is propelled along through it by little layers of muscles
  on each side meeting <!-- Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page235"></a>[235]</span>above and below. It is this canal that is
  inflamed by the disease known as gonorrh&oelig;a.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Prostrate Gland.</b>&mdash;The prostrate gland is located just
  before the bladder. It swells in men who have previously overtaxed it,
  thus preventing all sexual intercourse, and becomes very troublesome to
  void urine. This is a very common trouble in old age.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Penal Gland.</b>&mdash;The penal gland, located at the end
  of the penis, becomes unduly enlarged by excessive action and has the
  consistency of India rubber. It is always enlarged by erection. It is
  this gland at the end that draws the semen forward. It is one of the most
  essential and wonderful constructed glands of the human body.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Female Magnetism.</b>&mdash;When the male organ comes in contact
  with female magnetism, the natural and proper excitement takes place.
  When excited without this female magnetism it becomes one of the most
  serious injuries to the human body. The male organ was made for a high
  and holy purpose, and woe be to him who pollutes his manhood by
  practicing the secret vice. He pays the penalty in after years either by
  the entire loss of sexual power, or by the afflictions of various urinary
  diseases.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Nature Pays</b> all her debts, and when there is an abuse of
  organ, penalties must follow. If the hand is thrust into the fire it will
  be burnt.</p>

    ANATOMY OR STRUCTURE OF THE FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION.
  </div>
  <p>1. The generative or reproductive organs of the human female are
  usually divided into the internal and external. Those regarded as
  internal are concealed from view and protected within the body. Those
  that can be readily perceived are termed external. The entrance of the
  vagina may be stated as the line of demarcation of the two divisions.

  <p>2. <b>Hymen or Vaginal Valve.</b>&mdash;This is a thin membrane of
  half moon shape stretched across the opening of the vagina. It usually
  contains before marriage one or more small openings for the passage of
  the menses. This membrane has been known to cause much distress in many
  females at the first menstrual flow. The trouble resulting from the
  openings in the hymen not being large enough to let the flow through and
  consequently blocking up the vaginal canal, and filling the entire <!--
  Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page237"></a>[237]</span>internal sexual organs with blood; causing
  paroxysms and hysterics and other alarming symptoms. In such cases the
  hymen must be ruptured that a proper discharge may take place at
  once.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Unyielding Hymen.</b>&mdash;The hymen is usually ruptured by the
  first sexual intercourse, but sometimes it is so unyielding as to require
  the aid of a knife before coition can take place.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The presence of the Hymen</b> was formerly considered a test of
  virginity, but this theory is no longer held by competent authorities, as
  disease or accidents or other circumstances may cause its rupture.</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Ovaries.</b>&mdash;The ovaries are little glands for the
  purpose of forming the female ova or egg. They are not fully developed
  until the period of puberty, and usually are about the size of a large
  chestnut. The are located in the broad ligaments between the uterus and
  the Fallopian tubes. During pregnancy the ovaries change position; they
  are brought farther into the abdominal cavity as the uterus expands.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Office of the Ovary.</b>&mdash;The ovary is to the female what
  the testicle is to the male. It is the germ vitalizing organ and the most
  essential part of the generative apparatus. The ovary is not only an
  organ for the formation of the ova, but is also designed for their
  separation when they reach maturity.</p>

  <p>7. <b><span class="correction" title="text reads `Fallopion'"
  >Fallopian</span> Tubes.</b>&mdash;These are the ducts that lead from the
  ovaries to the uterus. They are entirely detached from the glands or
  ovaries, and are developed on both sides of the body.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Office of the Fallopian Tubes.</b>&mdash;The Fallopian tubes
  have a double office: receiving the ova from the ovaries and conducting
  it into the uterus, as well as receiving the spermatic fluid of the male
  and conveying it from the uterus in the direction of the ovaries, the
  tubes being the seat of impregnation.</p>

    OVUM.
  </div>
  <p>9. <b>Sterility In Females.</b>&mdash;Sterility in the female is
  sometimes caused by a morbid adhesion of the tube to a portion of the
  ovary. By what power the mouth of the tube is directed toward a
  particular portion of an ovary from which the ovum is about to be
  discharged, remains entirely unknown, as does also the precise nature of
  the cause which effects this movement.</p>

    Ripe Ovum from the Ovary.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Scientific Theories.</b>&mdash;Darwin, Huxley, Haeckel, Tyndall,
  Meyer, and other renowned scientists, have tried to find the <i>missing
  link</i> between man and animal; they have also exhausted their genius in
  trying to fathom the mysteries of the beginning of life, or find where
  the animal and mineral kingdoms unite to form life; but they have added
  to the vast accumulation of theories only, and the world is but little
  wiser on this mysterious subject.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Physiology.</b>&mdash;Physiology has demonstrated what
  physiological changes take place in the germination and formation of
  life, and how nature expresses the intentions of reproduction by giving
  animals distinctive organs with certain secretions for this purpose, etc.
  All the different stages of development can be easily determined, but how
  and why life takes place under such special condition and under no other,
  is an unsolved mystery.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Ovaries.</b>&mdash;The ovaries are the essential parts of the
  generative system of the human female in which ova are matured. There are
  two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus, and connected with it by the
  Fallopian tubes. They are egg-shaped, about an inch in diameter, and
  furnish the <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page239"></a>[239]</span>germs or ovules. These germs or ovules are
  very small, measuring about 1/120 of an inch in diameter.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Development.</b>&mdash;The ovaries develop with the growth of
  the female, so that finally at the period of puberty they ripen and
  liberate an ovum or germ vesicle, which is carried into the uterine
  cavity of the Fallopian tubes. By the aid of the microscope we find that
  these ova are composed of granular substance, in which is found a
  miniature yolk surrounded by a transparent membrane called the zona
  pellucida. This yolk contains a germinal vesicle in which can be
  discovered a nucleus, called the germinal spot. The process of the growth
  of the ovaries is very gradual, and their function of ripening and
  discharging one ovum monthly into the Fallopian tubes and uterus, is not
  completed until between the twelfth and fifteenth years.</p>

  <p>5. <b>What Science Knows.</b>&mdash;After the sexual embrace we know
  that the sperm is lifted within the genital passages or portion of the
  vagina and mouth of the uterus. The time between the deposit of the semen
  and fecundation varies according to circumstances. If the sperm-cell
  travels to the ovarium it generally takes from three to five days to make
  the journey. As Dr. Pierce says: "The transportation is aided by the
  ciliary processes (little hairs) of the mucous surface of the vaginal and
  uterine walls, as well as by its own vibratile movements. The action of
  the cilia, under the stimulus of the sperm, seems to be from without,
  inward. Even if a minute particle of sperm, less than a drop, be left
  upon the margin of the external genitals of the female, it is sufficient
  in <span class="correction" title="text reads `amouut'">amount</span> to
  impregnate, and can be carried, by help of these cilia, to the
  ovaries."</p>

  <p>6. <b>Conception.</b>&mdash;After intercourse at the proper time the
  liability to conception is very great. If the organs are in a healthy
  condition, conception must necessarily follow, and no amount of prudence
  and the most rigid precautions often fail to prevent pregnancy.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Only One Absolutely Safe Method.</b>&mdash;There is only one
  absolutely safe method to prevent conception, entirely free from danger
  and injury to health, and one that is in the reach of all; that is to
  refrain from union altogether.</p>

<h2>PREVENTION OF CONCEPTION.</h2>

    THE PATIENT MOTHER.
  </div>
  <p>1. The question is always asked, "Can Conception be prevented at all
  times?" Certainly, this is possible; but such an interference with
  nature's laws is inadmissible, and perhaps never to be justified in any
  case whatever, except in cases of deformity or disease.</p>

  <p>2. If the parties of a marriage are both feeble and so adapted to each
  other that their children are deformed, insane or idiots, then to beget
  offspring would be a flagrant wrong; if the mother's health is in such a
  condition as to forbid the right of laying the burden of motherhood upon
  her, then medical aid may safely come to her relief. If the man, however,
  respects his wife, he ought to come to her relief without the counsel of
  a physician. <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page241"></a>[241]</span></p>

  <p>3. <b>Forbearance.</b>&mdash;Often before the mother has recovered
  from the effects of bearing, nursing and rearing one child, ere she has
  regained proper tone and vigor of body and mind, she is unexpectedly
  overtaken, surprised by the manifestation of symptoms which again
  indicate pregnancy. Children thus begotten cannot become hardy and
  long-lived. By the love that parents may feel for their posterity, by the
  wishes for their success, by the hopes for their usefulness, by every
  consideration for their future well-being, let them exercise precaution
  and forbearance until the wife becomes sufficiently healthy and enduring
  to bequeath her own rugged, vital stamina to the child she bears in
  love.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Impostors.</b>&mdash;During the past few years hundreds of books
  and pamphlets have been written on the subject, claiming that new
  remedies had been discovered for the prevention of conception, etc., but
  these are all money making devices to deceive the public, and enrich the
  pockets of miserable and unprincipled impostors.</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Follies of Prevention.</b>&mdash;Dr. Pancoast, an eminent
  authority, says: "The truth is, there is no medicine taken internally
  capable of preventing conception, and the person who asserts to the
  contrary, not only speaks falsely, but is both a knave and a fool. It is
  true enough that remedies may be taken to produce abortion after
  conception occurs; but those who prescribe and those who resort to such
  desperate expedients, can only be placed in the category of lunatics and
  assassins!"</p>

  <p>6. <b>Patent Medicines.</b>&mdash;If nature does not promptly respond,
  there are many patent medicines which when taken at the time the monthly
  flow is to begin, will produce the desired result. Let women beware; for
  it is only a question of a few years when their constitution, complexion,
  and health will be a sorry evidence of their folly. The woman who
  continually takes a drug to prevent conception, cannot retain her natural
  complexion; her eyes will become dull, her cheeks flabby, and she will
  show various evidences of poor health, and her sexual organs will soon
  become permanently impaired and hopelessly diseased.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Foolish Dread of Children.</b>&mdash;What is more deplorable and
  pitiable than an old couple childless. Young people dislike the care and
  confinement of children and prefer society and social entertainments and
  thereby do great injustice and injury to their health and fit themselves
  in later years to visit infirmities and diseases upon their children. The
  vigilant and rigid measures which have to be resorted to in order to
  prevent conception for a period of years unfits many a wife for the
  production of healthy children. <!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page242"></a>[242]</span></p>

  <p>8. <b>Having Children</b> under proper circumstances never ruins the
  health and happiness of any woman. In fact, womanhood is incomplete
  without them. She may have a dozen or more, and still have better health
  than before marriage. It is having them too close together, and when she
  is not in a fit state, that her health gives way. Sometimes the mother is
  diseased; the outlet from the womb, as a result of laceration by a
  previous child-birth, is frequently enlarged, thus allowing conception to
  take place very readily, and hence she has children in rapid
  succession.</p>

  <p>Besides the wrong to the mother in having children in such rapid
  succession, it is a great injustice to the babe in the womb and the one
  at the breast that they should follow each other so quickly that one is
  conceived while the other is nursing. One takes the vitality of the
  other; neither has sufficient nourishment, and both are started in life
  stunted and incomplete.</p>

  <p>9. <b>"The Desirability and Practicability</b> of limiting offspring,"
  says Dr. Stockham, "are the subject of frequent inquiry. Fewer and better
  children are desired by right-minded parents. Many men and women, wise in
  other things of the world, permit generation as a chance result of
  copulation, without thought of physical or mental conditions to be
  transmitted to the child. Coition, the one important act of all others,
  carrying with it the most vital results, is usually committed for selfish
  gratification. Many a drunkard owes his life-long appetite for alcohol to
  the fact that the inception of his life could be traced to a night of
  dissipation on the part of his father. Physical degeneracy and mental
  derangements are too often caused by the parents producing offspring
  while laboring under great mental strain or bodily fatigue. Drunkenness
  and licentiousness are frequently the heritage of posterity. Future
  generations demand that such results be averted by better pre-natal
  influences. The world is groaning under the curse of chance parenthood.
  It is due to posterity that procreation be brought under the control of
  reason and conscience.</p>

  <p>10. <b>"It Has Been Feared that a Knowledge</b> of means to prevent
  conception would, if generally diffused, be abused by women; that they
  would to so great an extent escape motherhood as to bring about social
  disaster. This fear is not well founded. The maternal instinct is
  inherent and sovereign in woman. Even the pre-natal influences of a
  murderous intent on the part of parents scarcely ever <!-- Page 243
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>[243]</span>eradicate it.
  With this natural desire for children, we believe few women would abuse
  the knowledge or privilege of controlling conception. Although women
  shrink from forced maternity, and from the bearing of children under the
  great burden of suffering, as well as other adverse conditions, it is
  rare to find a woman who is not greatly disappointed if she does not,
  some time in her life, wear the crown of motherhood.</p>

  <p>"An eminent lady teacher, in talking to her pupils, once said: 'The
  greatest calamity that can befall a woman is never to have a child. The
  next greatest calamity is to have one only.' From my professional
  experience I am happy to testify that more women seek to overcome causes
  of sterility than to obtain knowledge of limiting the size of the family
  or means to destroy the embryo. Also, if consultation for the latter is
  sought, it is usually at the instigation of the husband. Believing in the
  rights of unborn children, and in the maternal instinct, I am
  consequently convinced that no knowledge should be withheld that will
  secure proper conditions for the best parenthood.</p>

  <p>11. <b>"Many of the Means Used to Prevent</b> conception are
  injurious, and often lay the foundation for a train of physical ailments.
  Probably no one means is more serious in its results than the practice of
  withdrawal, or the discharge of the semen externally to the vagina. The
  act is incomplete and unnatural, and is followed by results similar to
  and as disastrous as those consequent upon <i>masturbation</i>. In the
  male it may result in impotence, in the female in sterility. In both
  sexes many nervous symptoms are produced, such as headache, defective
  vision, dyspepsia, insomnia, loss of memory, etc. Very many cases of
  uterine diseases can be attributed solely to this practice. The objection
  to the use of the syringe is that if the sperm has passed into the uterus
  the fluid cannot reach it. A cold fluid may, in some instances, produce
  contractions to throw it off, but cannot be relied upon."</p>

  <p>12. <b>Is It Ever Right to Prevent Conception?</b> We submit the
  following case of the <i>Juke</i> family, mostly of New York State, as
  related by R. L. Dugdale, when a member of the Prison Association, and
  let the reader judge for himself:</p>

  <p>"It was traced out by painstaking research that from one woman called
  Margaret, who, like Topsy, merely 'growed' without pedigree as a pauper
  in a village on the upper Hudson, about eighty-five years ago, there
  descended 673 <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page244"></a>[244]</span>children, grandchildren, and
  great-grandchildren, of whom 200 were criminals of the dangerous class,
  280 adult paupers, and fifty prostitutes, while 300 children of her
  lineage died prematurely. The last fact proves to what extent in this
  family nature was kind to the rest of humanity in saving it from a still
  larger aggregation of undesirable and costly members, for it is estimated
  that the expense to the State of the descendants of Maggie was over a
  million dollars, and the State itself did something also towards
  preventing a greater expense by the restrain exercised upon the
  criminals, paupers, and idiots of the family during a considerable
  portion of their lives."</p>

  <p>13. <b>The Legal Aspect.</b>&mdash;By the Revised Statutes of the
  United States it is provided "that no obscene, * * * or lascivious book,
  picture, or any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention
  of conception or producing of abortion shall be carried in the mail, and
  any person who shall knowingly deposit or cause to be deposited for
  mailing or delivery any of the hereinbefore mentioned things shall be
  guilty of misdemeanor," etc. In New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas
  and District of Columbia we find no local law against abortion. Nine
  states, viz.: New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Wisconsin,
  Dakotas, Wyoming and California punish the woman upon whom the abortion
  is attempted; while Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,
  Nebraska, Kansas and California punish the advertising or furnishing of
  means for the prevention of conception; and Ohio makes it a crime to even
  have such means in one's possession. There is exception made in favor of
  every case where the early birth of the infant is necessary to save the
  life of the mother. It will be noticed that the common law punishes the
  furnishing or advertising of means for the prevention of conception, and
  hence regards it as a crime. There is, however, no ban of the civil law
  on Nature's law as laid down by Nature's God and discovered by medical
  science, which we here make known.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Is Nature's Method Reliable?</b>&mdash;Dr. Cowan says: "Sexual
  excitement hastens the premature ripening and meeting of the germ cell
  with the sperm cell, and impregnation may result, although intercourse
  occurs only in the specified two weeks' absence of the egg from the
  uterus."</p>

  <p>This is just possible under certain peculiar circumstances of diseased
  conditions, or after long separation of husband and wife. However, it
  seldom happens, and married people in normal health, temperate in the
  sexual relation, desirous of controlling the size of their family, can
  usually depend upon this law.</p>

<p><!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>[245]</span></p>

  <p>15. <b>Moderation.</b>&mdash;Continence, self-control, a willingness
  to deny himself&mdash;that is what is required from the husband. But a
  thousand voices reach us from suffering women in all parts of the land
  that this will not suffice; that men refuse thus to restrain themselves;
  that it leads to a loss of domestic happiness and to illegal amour, or it
  is injurious physically and morally; that, in short, such advice is
  useless because impracticable.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Nature's Method.</b>&mdash;To such we reply that Nature herself
  has provided, to some extent, against over-production, and that it is
  well to avail ourselves of her provision. It is well known that women,
  when nursing, rarely become pregnant, and for this reason, if for no
  other, women should nurse their own children, and continue the period
  until the child is at least nine months or a year old. However, the
  nursing, if continued too long, weakens both the mother and the child,
  and, moreover, ceases to accomplish the end for which we now recommend
  it.</p>

  <p>17. <b>Another Provision of Nature.</b>&mdash;For a certain period
  between her monthly illness, every woman is sterile. Conception may be
  avoided by refraining from coition except for this particular number of
  days, and there will be no evasion of natural intercourse, no resort to
  disgusting practices, and nothing degrading. The following facts have
  been established, without a doubt: The Graafian Vesicle, containing the
  egg in the ovary, enlarges during menstruation and bursts open to let the
  egg escape usually on the first day after the flow ceases, and seldom, if
  ever, later than the fourth day. It then takes from two to six days for
  the egg to pass down through the Fallopian tube into the womb, where it
  remains from two to six days, when, if not impregnated, it passes down
  through the vagina from the body. After the egg has passed from the body,
  conception is not possible until after the next menstrual flow.</p>

  <p>The period, therefore, from after the sixteenth to within three days
  of the following menstrual discharge is one of almost absolute safety. We
  say within three days of the next menstruation, because the male seminal
  fluid may be retained there till the egg leaves the ovary, and in that
  way impregnation might follow. Impregnation would, however, rarely occur
  if the period was extended to from the twelfth day after menstruation
  close up to one day before it began again.</p>

  <p>The above is the only physiological method (and it is no secret to a
  great many people) by which conception can be limited, without the
  employment of such means as involve danger and serious evils.</p>

  <p>18. <b>Warning.</b>&mdash;Let women be warned in the most emphatic
  manner against the employment of the secret methods constantly advertised
  by quacks. Such means are the almost certain cause of painful uterine
  diseases and of shortened life. They are productive of more misery by far
  than over-production itself.</p>

<h2>VAGINAL CLEANLINESS.</h2>

  <p>1. The above Syringe has a patent tube known as the vaginal cleanser.
  This keeps the sides of the vagina apart and permits the water to
  thoroughly clean and cleanse the organ. It will be found a great relief
  in both health and sickness, and in many cases cure barrenness and other
  diseases of the womb. It can be used the same as any other syringe. The
  tube can be procured at almost any drug store and applied to either bulb
  or fountain syringe. Many women are barren on account of an acid
  secretion in the vagina. The cleanser is almost a certain remedy and
  cure.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Cleanliness.</b>&mdash;Cleanliness is next to godliness. Without
  cleanliness the human body is more or less defiled and repulsive. A hint
  to the wise is sufficient. The vagina should be cleansed with the same
  faithfulness as any other portion of the body.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Temperature of the Water.</b>&mdash;Those not accustomed to use
  vaginal injections would do well to use water milk-warm at the
  commencement; after this the temperature may be varied according to
  circumstances. In case of local inflammation use hot water. The
  indiscriminate use of cold water injections will be found rather
  injurious than beneficial, and a woman in feeble health will always find
  warm water invigorating and preferable.</p>

<p><!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>[247]</span></p>

  <p>4. <b>Leucorrh&oelig;a.</b>&mdash;In case of persistent
  leucorrh&oelig;a use the temperature of water from seventy-two to
  eighty-five degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Cleanser</b> will greatly stimulate the health and spirits
  of any woman who uses it. Pure water injections have a stimulating
  effect, and it seems to invigorate the entire body.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Salt and Water Injections.</b>&mdash;This will cure mild cases
  of leucorrh&oelig;a. Add a teaspoonful of salt to a pint and a half of
  water at the proper temperature. Injections may be repeated daily if
  deemed necessary.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Soap and Water.</b>&mdash;Soap and water is a very simple
  domestic remedy, and will many times afford relief in many diseases of
  the womb. It seems it thoroughly cleanses the parts. A little borax or
  vinegar may be used the same as salt water injections. (See No. 6.)</p>

  <p>8. <b>Sterile Women</b> desiring offspring should seek sexual union
  soon after the appearance of the menses, and not use the vaginal cleanser
  till several days later. Those not desiring offspring should avoid
  copulation until the ovum has passed the generative tract.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Holes in the Tubes.</b>&mdash;Most of the holes in the tubes of
  syringes are too small. See that they are sufficiently large to produce
  thorough cleansing.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Injections During the Monthly Flow.</b>&mdash;Of course it is
  not proper to arrest the flow, and the injections will stimulate a
  healthy action of the organs. The injections may be used daily throughout
  the monthly flow with much comfort and benefit. If the flow is scanty and
  painful the injections may be as warm as they can be comfortably borne.
  If the flowing is immoderate, then cool water may be used. A woman will
  soon learn her own condition and can act accordingly.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Bloom and Grace of Youth.</b>&mdash;The regular bathing of the
  body will greatly improve woman's beauty. Remember that a perfect
  complexion depends upon the healthy action of all the organs. Vaginal
  injections are just as important as the bath. A beautiful woman must not
  only be cleanly, but robust and healthy. There can be no perfect beauty
  without good health.</p>

  <p>1. Actual impotence during the period of manhood is a very rare
  complaint, and nature very unwillingly, and only after the absolute
  neglect of sanitary laws, gives up the power of reproduction.</p>

  <p>2. Not only sensual women, but all without exception, feel deeply
  hurt, and are repelled by the husband whom they may previously have loved
  dearly, when, after entering the married state, they find that he is
  impotent. The more inexperienced and innocent they were at the time of
  marriage, the longer it often is before they find that something is
  lacking in the husband; but, once knowing this, the wife infallibly has a
  feeling of contempt and aversion for him; though there are many happy
  families where this defect exists. It is often very uncertain who is the
  weak one, and no cause for separation should be sought.</p>

  <p>3. Unhappy marriages, barrenness, divorces, and perchance an
  occasional suicide, may be prevented by the experienced physician, who
  can generally give correct information, comfort, and consolation, when
  consulted on these delicate matters.</p>

  <p>4. When a single man fears that he is unable to fulfill the duties of
  marriage, he should not marry until his fear is dispelled. The suspicion
  of such a fear strongly tends to bring about the very weakness which he
  dreads. Go to a good physician (not to one of those quacks whose <!--
  Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  are invariably unreliable), and state the case fully and freely.</p>

  <p>5. Diseases, malformation, etc., may cause impotence. In case of
  malformation there is usually no remedy, but in case of disease it is
  usually within the reach of a skillful physician.</p>

  <p>6. Self-abuse and spermatorrh&oelig;a produce usually only temporary
  impotence and can generally be relieved by carrying out the instructions
  given elsewhere in this book.</p>

  <p>7. Excessive indulgences often enfeeble the powers and often result in
  impotence. Dissipated single men, professional libertines, and married
  men who are immoderate, often pay the penalty of their violations of the
  laws of nature, by losing their vital power. In such cases of excess
  there may be some temporary relief, but as age advances the effects of
  such indiscretion will become more and more manifest.</p>

  <p>8. The condition of sterility in man may arise either from a condition
  of the secretion which deprives it of its fecundating powers or it may
  spring from a malformation which prevents it reaching the point where
  fecundation takes place. The former condition is most common in old age,
  and is a sequence of venereal disease, or from a change in the structure
  or functions of the glands. The latter has its origin in a stricture, or
  in an injury, or in that condition technically known as hypospadias, or
  in debility.</p>

  <p>9. It can be safely said that neither self-indulgence nor
  spermatorrh&oelig;a often leads to permanent sterility.</p>

  <p>10. It is sometimes, however, possible, even where there is sterility
  in the male, providing the secretion is not entirely devoid of life
  properties on part of the husband, to have children, but these are
  exceptions.</p>

  <p>11. No man need hesitate about matrimony on account of sterility,
  unless that condition arises from a permanent and absolute degeneration
  of his functions.</p>

  <p>12. Impotence from mental and moral causes often takes place. Persons
  of highly nervous organization may suffer incapacity in their sexual
  organs. The remedy for these difficulties is rest and change of
  occupation.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Remedies in case of Impotence on account of former Private
  Diseases, or Masturbation, or other causes.</b>&mdash;First build up the
  body by taking some good stimulating tonics. The general health is the
  most essential feature to be considered, in order to secure restoration
  of the sexual powers. Constipation must be carefully avoided. If the <!--
  Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>[250]</span>kidneys do not work in good order, some
  remedy for their restoration must be taken. Take plenty of out-door <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `excercise'">exercise</span>, avoid
  horseback riding or heavy exhaustive work.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Food and Drinks which Weaken Desire.</b>&mdash;All kinds of
  food which cause dyspepsia or bring on constipation, diarrh&oelig;a, or
  irritate the bowels, alcoholic beverages, or any indigestible compound,
  has the tendency to weaken the sexual power. Drunkards and tipplers
  suffer early loss of vitality. Beer drinking has a tendency to irritate
  the stomach and to that extent affects the private organs.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Coffee.</b>&mdash;Coffee drank excessively causes a
  debilitating effect upon the sexual organs. The moderate use of coffee
  can be recommended, yet an excessive habit of drinking very strong coffee
  will sometimes wholly destroy vitality.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Tobacco.</b>&mdash;It is a hygienic and physiological fact that
  tobacco produces sexual debility and those who suffer any weakness from
  that source should carefully avoid the weed in all its forms.</p>

  <p>17. <b>Drugs which Stimulate Desire.</b>&mdash;There are certain
  medicines which act locally on the membranes and organs of the male, and
  the papers are full of advertisements of "Lost Manhood Restored", etc.,
  but in every case they are worthless or dangerous drugs and certain to
  lead to some painful malady or death. All these patent medicines should
  be carefully avoided. People who are troubled with any of these ailments
  should not attempt to doctor themselves by taking drugs, but a competent
  physician should be consulted. Eating rye, corn, or graham bread,
  oatmeal, cracked wheat, plenty of fruit, etc. is a splendid medicine. If
  that is not sufficient, then a physician should be consulted.</p>

  <p>18. <b>Drugs which Moderate Desire.</b>&mdash;Among one of the most
  common domestic remedies is camphor. This has stood the test for ages.
  Small doses of half a grain in most instances diminishes the sensibility
  of the organs of sex. In some cases it produces irritation of the
  bladder. In that case it should be at once discontinued. On the whole a
  physician had better be consulted. The safest drug among domestic
  remedies is a strong tea made out of hops. Saltpeter, or nitrate of
  potash, taken in moderate quantities, are very good remedies.</p>

<p><!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>[251]</span></p>

  <p>19. <b>Strictly Speaking</b> there is a distinction made between
  <i>impotence</i> and <i>sterility</i>. <i>Impotence</i> is a loss of
  power to engage in the sexual act and is common to men. It may be
  imperfection in the male organ or a lack of sufficient sexual vigor to
  produce and maintain erection. <i>Sterility</i> is a total loss of
  capacity in the reproduction of the species, and is common to women.</p>

  <p>There are, however, very few causes of barrenness that cannot be
  removed when the patient is perfectly developed. Sterility, in a female,
  most frequently depends upon a weakness or irritability either in the
  ovaries or the womb, and anything having a strengthening effect upon
  either organ will remove the disability. (See page <a
  href="#page249">249</a>.)</p>

  <p>20. <b>"Over-Indulgence</b> in intercourse," says Dr. Hoff, "is
  sometimes the cause of barrenness; this is usually puzzling to the
  interested parties, inasmuch as the practices which, in their opinion,
  should be the source of a numerous progeny, have the very opposite
  effect. By greatly moderating their ardor, this defect may be
  remedied."</p>

  <p>21. <b>"Napoleon and Josephine.</b>&mdash;A certain adaptation between
  the male and female has been regarded as necessary to conception,
  consisting of some mysterious influence which one sex exerts over the
  other, neither one, however, being essentially impotent or sterile. The
  man may impregnate one woman and not another, and the woman will conceive
  by one man and not by another. In the marriage of Napoleon Bonaparte and
  Josephine no children were born, but after he had separated from the
  Empress and wedded Maria Louisa of Austria, an heir soon came. Yet
  Josephine had children by Beauharnais, her previous husband. But as all
  is not known as to the physical condition of Josephine during her second
  marriage, it cannot be assumed that mere lack of adaptability was the
  cause of unfruitfulness between them. There may have been some cause that
  history has not recorded, or unknown to the state of medical science of
  those days. There are doubtless many cases of apparently causeless
  unfruitfulness in marriage that even physicians, with a knowledge of all
  apparent conditions in the parties, cannot explain; but when, as
  elsewhere related in this volume, impregnation by artificial means is
  successfully practised, it is useless to attribute barrenness to purely
  psychological and adaptative influences."</p>

<h2>Producing Boys or Girls at Will.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Can the Sexes be Produced at Will?</b>&mdash;This question has
  been asked in all ages of the world. Many theories have been advanced,
  but science has at last replied with some authority. The following are
  the best known authorities which this age of science has produced.</p>

  <p>2. <b>The Agricultural Theory.</b>&mdash;The agricultural theory, as
  it may be called, because adopted by farmers, is that impregnation
  occurring within four days of the close of the female monthlies produces
  a girl, because the ovum is yet immature; but that when it occurs after
  the fourth day from its close, gives a boy, because this egg is now
  mature; whereas after about the eighth day this egg dissolves and passes
  off, so that impregnation is thereby rendered impossible, till just
  before the mother's next monthly.&mdash;<i>Sexual Science.</i></p>

  <p>3. <b>Queen Bees Lay Female Eggs First</b>, and male afterwards. So
  with hens; the first eggs laid after the tread give females, the last
  males. Mares shown the stallion late in their periods drop horse colts
  rather than fillies.&mdash;<i>Napheys.</i></p>

  <p>4. <b>If You Wish Females</b>, give the male at the first sign of
  heat; if males, at its end.&mdash;<i>Prof. Thury.</i></p>

  <p>5. <b>On Twenty-two Successive Occasions</b> I desired to have
  heifers, and succeeded in every case. I have made in all twenty-nine
  experiments, after this method, and succeeded in every one, in producing
  the sex I desired.&mdash;<i>A Swiss Breeder.</i></p>

  <p>6. <b>This Thury Plan</b> has been tried on the farms of the Emperor
  of the French with unvarying success.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Conception in the First Half</b> of the time between the
  menstrual periods produces females, and males is the
  latter.&mdash;<i>London Lancet.</i></p>

  <p>8. <b>Intercourse</b> in from two to six days after cessation of the
  menses produces girls, in from nine to twelve, boys.&mdash;<i>Medical
  Reporter.</i></p>

  <p>9. <b>The Most Male Power</b> and passion creates boys; female girls.
  This law probably causes those agricultural facts just cited thus:
  Conception right after menstruation give girls, because the female is
  then the most impassioned; later, boys, because her wanting sexual warmth
  leaves him the most vigorous. Mere sexual excitement, a wild, fierce,
  furious rush of passion, is not only not sexual vigor, but in its inverse
  ratio; and a genuine insane fervor caused by weakness; just as a like
  nervous excitability indicates weak nerves instead of strong. Sexual
  power is deliberate, not wild; cool, not impetuous; while all false
  excitement diminishes effectiveness.&mdash;<i>Fowler.</i></p>

<h2>ABORTION OR MISCARRIAGE.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

    HEALTHY CHILDREN.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Abortion or Miscarriage</b> is the expulsion of the child from
  the womb previous to six months; after that it is called premature
  birth.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Causes.</b>&mdash;It may be due to a criminal act of taking
  medicine for the express purpose of producing miscarriage or it may be
  caused by certain medicines, severe sickness or nervousness, syphilis,
  imperfect semen, lack of room in the pelvis and abdomen, lifting,
  straining, violent cold, sudden mental excitement, excessive sexual
  intercourse, dancing, tight lacing, the use of strong purgative
  medicines, bodily fatigue, late suppers, and fashionable amusements.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;A falling or weakness and uneasiness in the
  region of the loins, thighs and womb, pain in the small <!-- Page 254
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>[254]</span>of the back,
  vomiting and sickness of the stomach, chilliness with a discharge of
  blood accompanied with pain in the lower portions of the abdomen. These
  may take place in a single hour, or it may continue for several days. If
  before the fourth month, there is not so much danger, but the flow of
  blood is generally greater. If miscarriage is the result of an accident,
  it generally takes place without much warning, and the service of a
  physician should at once be secured.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Home Treatment.</b>&mdash;A simple application of cold water
  externally applied will produce relief, or cold cloths of ice, if
  convenient, applied to the lower portions of the abdomen. Perfect quiet,
  however, is the most essential thing for the patient. She should lie on
  her back and take internally a teaspoonful of paregoric every two hours;
  drink freely of lemonade or other cooling drinks, and for nourishment
  subsist chiefly on chicken broth, toast, water gruel, fresh fruits, etc.
  The principal homeopathic remedies for this disease are ergot and
  cimicifuga, given in drop-doses of the tinctures.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Injurious Effects.</b>&mdash;Miscarriage is a very serious
  difficulty, and the health and the constitution may be permanently
  impaired. Any one prone to miscarriage should adopt every measure
  possible to strengthen and build up the system; avoid going up stairs or
  doing much heavy lifting or hard work.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Prevention.</b>&mdash;Practice the laws of sexual abstinence,
  take frequent sitz-baths, live on oatmeal, graham bread, and other
  nourishing diet. Avoid highly seasoned food, rich gravies, late suppers
  and the like.</p>

    AN INDIAN FAMILY. The Savage Indian Teaches Us Lessons of Civilization.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Many Causes.</b>&mdash;Many causes have operated to produce a
  corruption of the public morals so deplorable; prominent among which may
  be mentioned the facility with which divorces may be obtained in some of
  the States, the constant promulgation of false ideas of marriage and its
  duties by means of books, lectures, etc., and the distribution through
  the mails of impure publications. But an influence not less powerful than
  any of these is the growing devotion of fashion and luxury of this age,
  and the idea which practically obtains to so great an extent that
  pleasure, instead of the health or morals, is the great object of
  life.</p>

  <p>2. <b>A Monstrous Crime.</b>&mdash;The abiding interest we feel in the
  preservation of the morals of our country, constrains us to raise our
  voice against the daily increasing practice of <!-- Page 256 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>[256]</span>infanticide, especially
  before birth. The notoriety this monstrous crime has obtained of late,
  and the hecatombs of infants that are annually sacrificed to Moloch, to
  gratify an unlawful passion, are a sufficient justification for our
  alluding to a painful and delicate subject, which should "not even be
  named," only to correct and admonish the wrong-doers.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Localities in Which It Is Most Prevalent.</b>&mdash;We may
  observe that the crying sin of infanticide is most prevalent in those
  localities where the system of moral education has been longest
  neglected. This inhuman crime might be compared to the murder of the
  innocents, except that the criminals, in this case, exceed in enormity
  the cruelty of Herod.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Shedding Innocent Blood.</b>&mdash;If it is a sin to take away
  the life even of an enemy; if the crime of shedding innocent blood cries
  to heaven for vengeance; in what language can we characterize the double
  guilt of those whose souls are stained with the innocent blood of their
  own unborn, unregenerated offspring?</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Greatness of the Crime.</b>&mdash;The murder of an infant
  before its birth, is, in the sight of God and the law, as great a crime
  as the killing of a child after birth.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Legal Responsibility.</b>&mdash;Every State of the Union has
  made this offense one of the most serious crimes. The law has no mercy
  for the offenders that violate the sacred law of human life. It is murder
  of the most cowardly character and woe to him who brings this curse upon
  his head, to haunt him all the days of his or her life, and to curse him
  at the day of his death.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Product of Lust.</b>&mdash;Lust pure and simple. The only
  difference between a marriage of this character and prostitution is, that
  society, rotten to its heart, pulpits afraid to cry aloud against crime
  and vice, and the church conformed to the world, have made such a
  profanation of marriage respectable. To put it in other words, when two
  people determine to live together as husband and wife, and evade the
  consequences and responsibilities of marriage, they are simply engaged in
  prostitution without the infamy which attaches to that vice and
  crime.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Outrageous Violation of All Law.</b>&mdash;The violation of all
  law, both natural and revealed, is the cool and villainous contract by
  which people entering into the marital relation engage in defiance of the
  laws of God and the laws of the commonwealth, that they shall be
  unincumbered with a family of children. "Disguise the matter as you
  will," says Dr. Pomeroy, "yet the fact remains that the first and <!--
  Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page257"></a>[257]</span>specific object of marriage is the rearing
  of a family." "Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth," is
  God's first word to Adam after his creation.</p>

  <p>9. <b>The National Sin.</b>&mdash;The prevention of offspring is
  preeminently the sin of America. It is fast becoming the national sin of
  America, and if it is not checked, it will sooner or later be an
  irremediable calamity. The sin has its roots in a low and perverted idea
  of marriage, and is fostered by false standards of modesty.</p>

  <p>10. <b>The Sin of Herod.</b>&mdash;Do these same white-walled
  sepulchres of hell know that they are committing the damning sin of Herod
  in the slaughter of the innocents, and are accessories before the fact to
  the crime of murder? Do women in all circles of society, when practicing
  these terrible crimes realize the real danger? Do they understand that it
  is undermining their health, and their constitution, and that their
  destiny, if persisted in, is a premature grave just as sure as the sun
  rises in the heavens? Let all beware, and let the first and only purpose
  be, to live a life guiltless before God and man.</p>

  <p>11. <b>The Crime of Abortion.</b>&mdash;From the moment of conception
  a new life commences; a new individual exists; another child is added to
  the family. The mother who deliberately sets about to destroy this life,
  either by want of care, or by taking drugs, or using instruments, commits
  as great a crime, and is just as guilty as if she strangled her new-born
  infant or as if she snatched from her own breast her six months' darling
  and dashed out its brains against the wall. Its blood is upon her head,
  and as sure as there is a God and a judgment, that blood will be required
  of her. The crime she commits is murder, child murder&mdash;the slaughter
  of a speechless, helpless being, whom it is her duty, beyond all things
  else, to cherish and preserve.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Dangerous Diseases.</b>&mdash;We appeal to all such with
  earnest and with threatening words. If they have no feeling for the fruit
  of their womb, if maternal sentiment is so callous in their breasts, let
  them know that such produced abortions are the constant cause of violent
  and dangerous womb diseases, and frequently of early death; that they
  bring on mental weakness, and often insanity; that they are the most
  certain means to destroy domestic happiness which can be adopted. Better,
  far better, to bear a child every year for twenty years than to resort to
  such a wicked and injurious step; better to die, if need be, in the pangs
  of child-birth, than to live with such a weight of sin on the
  conscience.</p>

<h2>The Unwelcome Child.<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></h2>

  <p>1. <b>Too Often the Husband</b> thinks only of his personal
  gratification; he insists upon what he calls his rights (?); forces on
  his wife an <i>unwelcome child</i>, and thereby often alienates her
  affections, if he does not drive her to abortion.</p>

  <p>Dr Stockham reports the following case: "A woman once consulted me who
  was the mother of five children, all born within ten years. These were
  puny, scrofulous, nervous and irritable. She herself was a fit subject
  for doctors and drugs. Every organ in her body seemed diseased, and every
  function perverted. She was dragging out a miserable existence. Like
  other physicians, I had prescribed in vain for her many maladies. One day
  she chanced to inquire how she could safely prevent conception. This led
  me to ask how great was the danger. She said: 'Unless my husband is
  absent from home, few nights have been exempt since we were married,
  except it may be three or four immediately after confinement.'</p>

  <p>"'And yet your husband loves you?'</p>

  <p>"'O, yes, he is kind and provides for his family. Perhaps I might love
  him but for this. While now&mdash;(will God forgive me?)&mdash;<i>I
  detest, I loathe him</i>, and if I knew how to support myself and
  children, I would leave him.'</p>

  <p>"'Can you talk with him upon this subject?'</p>

  <p>"'I think I can.'</p>

  <p>"' Then there is hope, for many women cannot do that. Tell him I will
  give you treatment to improve your health, and if he will wait until you
  can respond, <i>take time for the act, have it entirely mutual from first
  to last</i>, the demand will not come so frequent.'</p>

  <p>"'Do you think so?'</p>

  <p>"'The experience of many proves the truth of this statement.'</p>

  <p>"Hopefully she went home, and in six months I had the satisfaction of
  knowing my patient was restored to health, and a single coition in a
  month gave the husband more satisfaction than the many had done
  previously, that the creative power was under control, and that my lady
  could proudly say 'I love,' where previously she said 'I hate.'</p>

  <p>"If husbands will listen, a few simple instructions will <!-- Page 259
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>[259]</span>appeal to
  their <i>common sense</i>, and none can imagine the gain to themselves,
  to their wives and children, and their children's children. Then it may
  not be said of the babes that the 'Death borders on their birth, and
  their cradle stands in the grave.'"</p>

  <p>2. <b>Wives! Be Frank and True</b> to your husbands on the subject of
  maternity, and the relation that leads to it. Interchange thoughts and
  feelings with them as to what nature allows or demands in regard to
  these. Can maternity be natural when it is undesigned by the father or
  undesired by the mother? Can a maternity be natural, healthful, ennobling
  to the mother, to the child, to the father, and to the home, when no
  loving, tender, anxious forethought presides over the relation in which
  it originated?&mdash;when the mother's nature loathed and repelled it,
  and the father's only thought was his own selfish gratification; the
  feelings and conditions of the mother, and the health, character and
  destiny of the child that may result being ignored by him. Wives! let
  there be a perfect and loving understanding between you and your husbands
  on these matters, and great will be your reward.</p>

  <p>3. <b>A Woman Writes:</b>&mdash;"There are few, very few, wives and
  mothers who could not reveal a sad, dark picture in their own experience
  in their relations to their husbands and their children. Maternity, and
  the relation in which it originates, are thrust upon them by their
  husbands, often without regard to their spiritual or physical conditions,
  and often in contempt of their earnest and urgent entreaties. No joy
  comes to their heart at the conception and birth of their children,
  except that which arises from the consciousness that they have survived
  the sufferings wantonly and selfishly inflicted upon them."</p>

  <p>4. <b>Husband, When Maternity</b> is imposed on your wife without her
  consent, and contrary to her appeal, how will her mind necessarily be
  affected towards her child? It was conceived in dread and in bitterness
  of spirit. Every stage of its f&oelig;tal development is watched with
  feeling of settled repugnance. In every step of its ante-natal progress
  the child meets only with grief and indignation in the mother. She would
  crush out its life, if she could. She loathed its conception; she loathed
  it in every stage of its ante-natal development. Instead of fixing her
  mind on devising ways and means for the healthful and happy organization
  and <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page260"></a>[260]</span>development of her child before it is
  born, and for its postnatal comfort and support, her soul may be intent
  on its destruction, and her thoughts devise plans to kill it. In this,
  how often is she aided by others! There are those, and they are called
  men and women, whose profession is to devise ways to kill children before
  they are born. Those who do this would not hesitate (but for the
  consequences) to kill them after they are born, for the state of mind
  that would justify and instigate <i>ante-natal</i> child-murder would
  justify and instigate <i>post-natal</i> child-murder. Yet, public
  sentiment consigns the murderer of post-natal children to the dungeon or
  the gallows, while the murderers of ante-natal children are often allowed
  to pass in society as honest and honorable men and women.</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Following is an Extract</b> from a letter written by one who
  has proudly and nobly filled the station of a wife and mother, and whose
  children and grandchildren surround her and crown her life with tenderest
  love and respect:</p>

  <p>"It has often been a matter of wonder to me that men should, so
  heedlessly, and so injuriously to themselves, their wives and children,
  and their homes, demand at once, as soon as they get legal possession of
  their wives, the gratification of a passion, which, when indulged merely
  for the sake of the gratification of the moment, must end in the
  destruction of all that is beautiful, noble and divine in man or woman. I
  have often felt that I would give the world for a friendship with man
  that should show no impurity in its bearing, and for a conjugal relation
  that would, at all times, heartily and practically recognize the right of
  the wife to decide for herself when she should enter into the relation
  that leads to maternity."</p>

  <p>6. <b>Timely Advice.</b>&mdash;Here let me say that on no subject
  should a man and woman, as they are being attracted into conjugal
  relations, be more open and truthful with each other than on this. No
  woman, who would save herself and the man she loves from a desecrated and
  wretched home, should enter into the physical relations of marriage with
  a man until she understands what he expects of her as to the function of
  maternity, and the relation that leads to it. If a woman is made aware
  that the man who would win her as a wife regards her and the marriage
  relation only as the means of a legalized gratification of his passions,
  and she sees fit to live with him as a wife, with such a prospect before
  her, she must take the consequences of a course so <!-- Page 261 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>[261]</span>degrading and so
  shameless. If she sees fit to make an offering of her body and soul on
  the altar of her husband's sensuality, she must do it; but she has a
  right to know to what base uses her womanhood is to be put, and it is due
  to her, as well as to himself, that he should tell beforehand precisely
  what he wants and expects of her.</p>

  <p>Too frequently, man shrinks from all allusion, during courtship, to
  his expectations in regard to future passional relations. He fears to
  speak of them, lest he should shock and repel the woman he would win as a
  wife. Being conscious, it may be, of an intention to use power he may
  acquire over her person for his own gratification, he shuns all
  interchange of views with her, lest she should divine the hidden
  sensualism of his soul, and his intention to victimize her person to it
  the moment he shall get the license. A woman had better die at once than
  enter into or continue in marriage with a man whose highest conception of
  the relation is, that it is a means of licensed animal indulgence. In
  such a relation, body and soul are sacrificed.</p>

  <p>7. <b>One Distinctive Characteristic</b> of a true and noble husband
  is a feeling of manly pride in the physical elements of his manhood. His
  physical manhood, as well as his soul, is dear to the heart of his wife,
  because through this he can give the fullest expression of his manly
  power. How can you, my friend, secure for your person the loving care and
  respect of your wife? There is but one way: so manifest yourself to her,
  in the hours of your most endearing intimacies, that all your manly power
  shall be associated only with all that is generous, just and noble in
  you, and with purity, freedom and happiness in her. Make her feel that
  all which constitutes you a man, and qualifies you to be her husband and
  the father of her children, belongs to her, and is sacredly consecrated
  to the perfection and happiness of her nature. Do this, and the happiness
  of your home is made complete. Your <i>body</i> will be lovingly and
  reverently cared for, because the wife of your bosom feels that it is the
  sacred symbol through which a noble, manly love is ever speaking to her,
  to cheer and sustain her.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Woman is Ever Proud</b>, and justly so, of the manly passion of
  her husband, when she knows it is controlled by a love for her, whose
  manifestations have regard only to her elevation and happiness. The power
  which, when bent only on selfish indulgence, becomes a source of more
  shame, degradation, disease and wretchedness, to <!-- Page 262 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>[262]</span>women and to children
  than all other things put together, does but ennoble her, add grace and
  glory to her being, and concentrate and vitalize the love that encircles
  her as a wife when it is controlled by wisdom and consecrated to her
  highest growth and happiness, and that of her children. It lends
  enchantment to her person, and gives a fascination to her smiles, her
  words and her caresses, which ever breathe of purity and of heaven, and
  make her all lovely as a wife and mother to her husband and the father of
  her child. <i>Manly passion is to the conjugal love of the wife like the
  sun to the rose-bud, that opens its petals, and causes them to give out
  their sweetest fragrance and to display their most delicate tints; or
  like the frost, which chills and kills it ere it blossoms in its richness
  and beauty.</i></p>

  <p>9. <b>A Diadem of Beauty.</b>&mdash;Maternity, when it exists at the
  call of the wife, and is gratefully received, but binds her heart more
  tenderly and devotedly to her husband. As the father of her child, he
  stands before her invested with new beauty and dignity. In receiving from
  him the germ of a new life, she receives that which she feels is to add
  new beauty and glory to her as a woman&mdash;a new grace and attraction
  to her as a wife. She loves and honors him, because he has crowned her
  with the glory of a mother. Maternity, to her, instead of being
  repulsive, is a diadem of beauty, a crown of rejoicing; and deep, tender,
  and self-forgetting are her love and reverence for him who has placed it
  on her brow. How noble, how august, how beautiful is maternity when thus
  bestowed and received!</p>

  <p>10. <b>Conclusion.</b>&mdash;Would you, then, secure the love and
  trust of your wife, and become an object of her ever-growing tenderness
  and reverence? Assure her, by all your manifestations, and your perfect
  respect for the functions of her nature, that your passion shall be in
  subjection of her wishes. It is not enough that you have secured in her
  heart respect for your spiritual and intellectual manhood. To maintain
  your self-respect in your relations with her, to perfect your growth and
  happiness as a husband, you must cause your <i>physical</i> nature to be
  tenderly cherished and reverenced by her in all the sacred intimacies of
  home. No matter how much she reverences your intellectual or your social
  power, if by reason of your uncalled-for passional manifestations you
  have made your physical manhood disagreeable, how can you, in her
  presence, preserve a sense of manly pride and dignity as a husband?</p>

<h2>Heredity and the Transmission of
Diseases.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

      alt="Health and disease." title="Health and disease." /></a>
    HEALTH AND DISEASE.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Bad Habits.</b>&mdash;It is known that the girl who marries the
  man with bad habits, is, in a measure, responsible for the evil
  tendencies which these habits have created in the children; and young
  people are constantly warned of the danger in marrying when they know
  they come from families troubled with chronic diseases or insanity. To be
  sure the warnings have had little effect thus far in preventing such
  marriages, and it is doubtful whether they will, unless the prophecy of
  an extremist writing for one of our periodicals comes to pass&mdash;that
  the time is not far distant when such marriages will be a crime
  punishable by law. <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page264"></a>[264]</span></p>

  <p>2. <b>Tendency in the Right Direction.</b>&mdash;That there is a
  tendency in the right direction must be admitted, and is perhaps most
  clearly shown in some of the articles on prison reform. Many of them
  strongly urge the necessity of preventive work as the truest economy, and
  some go so far as to say that if the present human knowledge of the laws
  of heredity were acted upon for a generation, reformatory measures would
  be rendered unnecessary.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Serious Consequences.</b>&mdash;The mother who has ruined her
  health by late hours, highly-spiced food, and general carelessness in
  regard to hygienic laws, and the father who is the slave of questionable
  habits, will be very sure to have children either mentally or morally
  inferior to what they might otherwise have had a right to expect. But the
  prenatal influences may be such that evils arising from such may be
  modified to a great degree.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Formation of Character.</b>&mdash;I believe that pre-natal
  influences may do as much in the formation of character as all the
  education that can come after, and that the mother may, in a measure,
  "will" what that influence shall be, and that, as knowledge on the
  subject increases, it will be more and more under their control. In that,
  as in everything else, things that would be possible with one mother
  would not be with another, and measures that would be successful with one
  would produce opposite results from the other.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Inheriting Disease.</b> Consumption&mdash;that dread foe of
  modern life&mdash;is the most frequently encountered of all affections as
  the result of inherited predispositions. Indeed, some of the most eminent
  physicians have believed it is never produced in any other way. Heart
  disease, disease of the throat, excessive obesity, affections of the
  skin, asthma, disorders of the brain and nervous system, gout, rheumatism
  and cancer, are all hereditary. A tendency to bleed frequently, profusely
  and uncontrollably, from trifling wounds, is often met with as a family
  affection.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Mental Derangements.</b>&mdash;Almost all forms of mental
  derangements are hereditary&mdash;one of the parents or near relation
  being afflicted. Physical or bodily weakness is often hereditary, such as
  scrofula, gout, rheumatism, rickets, consumption, apoplexy, hernia,
  urinary calculi, hemorrhoids or piles, cataract, etc. In fact, all
  physical weakness, if ingrafted in either parent, is transmitted from
  parents to offspring, and is often more strongly marked in the latter
  than in the former.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Marks and Deformities.</b>&mdash;Marks and deformities are all
  transmissible from parents to offspring, equally with <!-- Page 265
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>[265]</span>diseases and
  peculiar proclivities. Among such blemishes may be mentioned moles,
  hair-lips, deficient or supernumerary fingers, toes, and other
  characteristics. It is also asserted that dogs and cats that have
  accidentally lost their tails, bring forth young similarly deformed.
  Blumenbach tells of a man who had lost his little finger, having children
  with the same deformity.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Caution.</b>&mdash;Taking facts like these into consideration,
  how very important is it for persons, before selecting partners for life,
  to deliberately weigh every element and circumstances of this nature, if
  they would insure a felicitous union, and not entail upon their posterity
  disease, misery and despair. Alas! in too many instances matrimony is
  made a matter of money, while all earthly joys are sacrificed upon the
  accursed altars of lust and mammon.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:20%;">

  </div>
<p><!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<h2>Preparation for Maternity.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Woman Before Marriage.</b>&mdash;It is not too much to say that
  the life of women before marriage ought to be adjusted with more
  reference to their duties as mothers than to any other one earthly
  object. It is the continuance of the race which is the chief purpose of
  marriage. The passion of amativeness is probably, on the whole, the most
  powerful of all human impulses. Its purpose, however, is rather to
  subserve the object of continuing the species, than merely its own
  gratification.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;Girls should be brought up to live much in
  the open air, always with abundant clothing against wet and cold. They
  should be encouraged to take much active exercise; as much, if they want
  to, as boys. It is as good for little girls to run and jump, to ramble in
  the woods, to go boating, to ride and drive, to play and "have fun"
  generally, as for little boys.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Preserve the Sight.</b>&mdash;Children should be carefully
  prevented from using their eyes to read or write, or in any equivalent
  exertion, either before breakfast, by dim daylight, or by artificial
  light. Even school studies should be such that they can be dealt with by
  daylight. Lessons that cannot be learned without lamp-light study are
  almost certainly excessive. This precaution should ordinarily be
  maintained until the age of puberty is reached.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Bathing.</b>&mdash;Bathing should be enforced according to
  constitutions, not by an invariable rule, except the invariable rule of
  keeping clean. Not necessarily every day, nor necessarily in cold water;
  though those conditions are doubtless often right in case of abundant
  physical health and strength.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Wrong Habits.</b>&mdash;The habit of daily natural evacuations
  should be solicitously formed and maintained. Words or figures could
  never express the discomforts and wretchedness which wrong habits in this
  particular have locked down upon innumerable women for years and even for
  life.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Dress.</b>&mdash;Dress should be warm, loose, comely, and modest
  rather than showy; but it should be good enough to satisfy a child's
  desires after a good appearance, if they are reasonable. Children,
  indeed, should have all their reasonable desires granted as far as
  possible; for nothing makes them reasonable so rapidly and so surely as
  to treat them reasonably.</p>

<p><!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>[267]</span></p>

  <p>7. <b>Tight Lacing.</b>&mdash;Great harm is often done to maidens for
  want of knowledge in them, or wisdom and care in their parents. The
  extremes of fashions are very prone to violate not only taste, but
  physiology. Such cases are tight lacing, low necked dresses, thin shoes,
  heavy skirts. And yet, if the ladies only knew, the most attractive
  costumes are not the extremes of fashion, but those which conform to
  fashion enough to avoid oddity, which preserve decorum and healthfulness,
  whether or no; and here is the great secret of successful
  dress&mdash;vary fashion so as to suit the style of the individual.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Courtship and Marriage.</b>&mdash;Last of all, parental care in
  the use of whatever influence can be exerted in the matter of courtship
  and marriage. Maidens, as well as youths, must, after all, choose for
  themselves. It is their own lives which they take in their hands as they
  enter the marriage state, and not their parents'; and as the consequences
  affect them primarily it is the plainest justice that with the
  responsibility should be joined the right of choice. The parental
  influence, then, must be indirect and advisory. Indirect, through the
  whole bringing up of their daughter; for if they have trained her aright,
  she will be incapable of enduring a fool, still more a knave.</p>

  <p>9. <b>A Young Woman and a Young Man Had Better Not Be Alone Together
  Very Much until They Are Married.</b>&mdash;This will be found to prevent
  a good many troubles. It is not meant to imply that either sex, or any
  member of it, is worse than another, or bad at all, or anything but
  human. It is simply the prescription of a safe general rule. It is no
  more an imputation than the rule that people had better not be left
  without oversight in presence of large sums of other folks' money. The
  close personal proximity of the sexes is greatly undesirable before
  marriage. Kisses and caresses are most properly the monopoly of wives.
  Such indulgences have a direct and powerful physiological effect. Nay,
  they often lead to the most fatal results.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Ignorance before Marriage.</b>&mdash;At some time before
  marriage those who are to enter into it ought to be made acquainted with
  some of the plainest common-sense limitations which should govern their
  new relations to each other. Ignorance in such matters has caused an
  infinite amount of disgust, pain, and unhappiness. It is not necessary to
  specify particulars here: see other portions of this work.</p>

<h2>Impregnation.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

      alt="A healthy mother." title="A healthy mother." /></a>
    A HEALTHY MOTHER.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Conception or Impregnation.</b>&mdash;Conception or impregnation
  takes place by the union of the male sperm and female sperm. Whether this
  is accomplished in the ovaries, the oviducts or the uterus, is still a
  question of discussion and investigation by physiologists.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Passing Off The Ovum.</b>&mdash;"With many woman," says Dr.
  Stockham in her Tokology, "the ovum passes off within twenty-four or
  forty-eight hours after menstruation begins. Some, by careful
  observation, are able to know with certainty when this takes place. It is
  often accompanied with malaise, nervousness, headache or actual uterine
  pain. A minute substance like the white of an egg; with a fleck of blood
  in it, can frequently be seen upon the clothing. Ladies who have noticed
  this phenomenon testify to its recurring very regularly upon the same day
  after menstruation. Some delicate women have observed it as late as the
  fourteenth day."</p>

  <p>3. <b>Calculations.</b>&mdash;Conception is more liable to take place
  either immediately before or immediately after the period, and, on that
  account it is usual when calculating the date at which to expect labor,
  to count from the day of disappearance of the last period. The easiest
  way to make a calculation is to count back three months from the date of
  the last period and add seven days; thus we might say that the date was
  the 18th of July; counting back brings us to the 18th of April, and
  adding the seven days will bring us to the 25th day of April, the
  expected time.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Evidence of Conception.</b>&mdash;Very many medical authorities,
  distinguished in this line, have stated their belief that women never
  pass more than two or three days at the most beyond the forty weeks
  conceded to pregnancy&mdash;that is two hundred and eighty days or ten
  lunar months, or nine calendar months and a week. About two hundred and
  eighty days will represent the average duration of pregnancy, counting
  from the last day of the last period. Now it must be borne in mind, that
  there are many disturbing elements which might cause the young married
  woman to miss a time. During the first month of pregnancy there is no
  sign by which the condition may be positively known. The missing of a
  period, especially in a person who has been regular for some time, may
  lead one to suspect it; but there are many attendant causes in married
  life, the little annoyances of household duties, embarrassments, and the
  enforced gayety which naturally surrounds the bride, and <!-- Page 270
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>[270]</span>these should
  all be taken into consideration in the discussion as to whether or not
  she is pregnant. But then, again, there are some rare cases who have
  menstruated throughout their pregnancy; and also cases where menstruation
  was never established and pregnancy occurred. Nevertheless, the
  non-appearance of the period, with other signs, may be taken as
  presumptive evidence.</p>

  <p>5. <b>"Artificial Impregnation.</b>&mdash;It may not be generally
  known that union is not essential to impregnation; it is possible for
  conception to occur without congress. All that is necessary is that
  seminal animalcules enter the womb and unite there with the egg or ovum.
  It is not essential that the semen be introduced through the medium of
  the male organ, as it has been demonstrated repeatedly that by means of a
  syringe and freshly obtained and healthy semen, impregnation can be made
  to follow by its careful introduction. There are physicians in France who
  make a specialty of "Artificial Impregnation," as it is called, and
  produce children to otherwise childless couples, being successful in many
  instances in supplying them as they are desired."</p>

<hr class="full" >

<h2>Signs and Symptoms of Pregnancy.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>The First Sign.</b>&mdash;The first sign that leads a lady to
  suspect that she is pregnant is her ceasing-to-be-unwell. This, provided
  she has just before been in good health, is a strong symptom of
  pregnancy; but still there must be others to corroborate it.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Abnormal Condition.</b>&mdash;Occasionally, women menstruate
  during the entire time of gestation. This, without doubt, is an abnormal
  condition, and should be remedied, as disastrous consequences may result.
  Also, women have been known to bear children who have never menstruated.
  The cases are rare of pregnancy taking place where menstruation has never
  occurred, yet it frequently happens that women never menstruate from one
  pregnancy to another. In these cases this symptom is ruled out for
  diagnotic purposes.</p>

  <p>3. <b>May Proceed from Other Causes.</b>&mdash;But a
  ceasing-to-be-unwell may proceed from other causes than that of
  pregnancy, such as disease or disorder of the womb or of other <!-- Page
  271 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271"></a>[271]</span>organs of
  the body&mdash;especially of the lungs&mdash;it is not by itself alone
  entirely to be depended upon; although, as a single sign, it is,
  especially if the patient be healthy, one of the most reliable of all the
  other signs of pregnancy.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Morning Sickness.</b>&mdash;If this does not arise from a
  disordered stomach, it is a trustworthy sign of pregnancy. A lady who has
  once had morning-sickness can always for the future distinguish it from
  each and from every other sickness; it is a peculiar sickness, which no
  other sickness can simulate. Moreover, it is emphatically a
  morning-sickness&mdash;the patient being, as a rule, for the rest of the
  day entirely free from sickness or from the feeling of sickness.</p>

    <p class="poem"><i>b</i>, the Back: <i>a</i> <i>a</i> <i>a</i>,
    Covering, and pinned to Back.</p>
  </div>
  <p>5. <b>A Third Symptom.</b>&mdash;A third symptom is shooting,
  throbbing and lancinating pains in, and enlargement of the breasts, with
  soreness of the nipples, occurring about the second month. In some
  instances, after the first few months, a small quantity of watery fluid
  or a little milk, may be squeezed out of them. This latter symptom, in a
  first pregnancy, is valuable, and can generally be relied on as fairly
  conclusive of pregnancy. Milk in the breast, however small it may be in
  quantity, especially in a first pregnancy, is a reliable sign, indeed, we
  might say, a certain sign, of pregnancy.</p>

  <p>6. <b>A Dark Brown Areola or Mark</b> around the nipple is one of the
  distinguishing signs of pregnancy&mdash;more especially of a first
  pregnancy. Women who have had large families, seldom, even when they are
  not pregnant, lose this mark entirely; but when they are pregnant it is
  more intensely dark&mdash;the darkest brown&mdash;especially if they be
  brunettes.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Quickening.</b>&mdash;Quickening is one of the most important
  signs of pregnancy, and one of the most valuable, as at the moment it
  occurs, as a rule, the motion of the child is first felt, whilst, at the
  same time, there is a sudden increase in the size of the abdomen.
  Quickening is a proof that nearly half the time of pregnancy has passed.
  If there be a <!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page272"></a>[272]</span>liability to miscarry, quickening makes
  matters more safe, as there is less likelihood of a miscarriage after
  than before it. A lady at this time frequently feels faint or actually
  faints away; she is often giddy, or sick, or nervous, and in some
  instances even hysterically; although, in rare cases, some women do not
  even know the precise time when they quicken.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Increased Size and Hardness of the Abdomen.</b>&mdash;This is
  very characteristic of pregnancy. When a lady is not pregnant the abdomen
  is soft and flaccid; when she is pregnant, and after she has quickened,
  the abdomen; over the region of the womb, is hard and resisting.</p>

    <i>d</i>, the Neck; <i>e</i>, the Chest; <i>f</i>, the Abdomen.
  </div>
  <p>9. <b>Excitability of Mind.</b>&mdash;Excitability of mind is very
  common in pregnancy, more especially if the patient be delicate; indeed,
  excitability is a sign of debility, and requires plenty of good
  nourishment, but few stimulants.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Eruptions on the Skin.</b>&mdash;Principally on the face, neck,
  or throat, are tell-tales of pregnancy, and to an experienced matron,
  publish the fact that an acquaintance thus marked is pregnant.</p>

<p><!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>[273]</span></p>

  <p>11. <b>The F&oelig;tal Heart.</b>&mdash;In the fifth month there is a
  sign which, if detected, furnishes indubitable evidence of conception,
  and that is the sound of the child's heart. If the ear be placed on the
  abdomen, over the womb, the beating of the f&oelig;tal heart can
  sometimes be heard quite plainly, and by the use of an instrument called
  the stethoscope, the sounds can be still more plainly heard. This is a
  very valuable sign, inasmuch as the presence of the child is not only
  ascertained, but also its position, and whether there are twins or
  more.</p>

  </div>
<h2>Diseases of Pregnancy.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Costive State of the Bowels.</b>&mdash;A costive state of the
  bowels is common in pregnancy; a mild laxative is therefore occasionally
  necessary. The mildest must be selected, as a strong purgative is highly
  improper, and even dangerous. Calomel and all other preparations of
  mercury are to be especially avoided, as a mercurial medicine is apt to
  weaken the system, and sometimes even to produce a miscarriage. Let me
  again urge the importance of a lady, during the whole period of
  pregnancy, being particular as to the state of her bowels, as costiveness
  is a fruitful cause of painful, tedious and hard labors.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Laxatives.</b>&mdash;The best laxatives are castor oil, salad
  oil, compound rhubarb pills, honey, stewed prunes, stewed rhubarb,
  Muscatel raisins, figs, grapes, roasted apples, baked pears, stewed
  Normandy pippins, coffee, brown-bread and treacle. Scotch oatmeal made
  with new milk or water, or with equal parts of milk and water.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Pills.</b>&mdash;When the motions are hard, and when the bowels
  are easily acted upon, two, or three, or four pills made of Castile soap
  will frequently answer the purpose; and if they will, are far better than
  any other ordinary laxative. The following is a good form. Take of:</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Castile Soap, five scruples;</p>
      <p>Oil of Caraway, six drops;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To make twenty-four pills. Two, or three, or four to be taken at
  bedtime, occasionally.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Honey.</b>&mdash;A teaspoonful of honey, either eaten at
  breakfast or dissolved in a cup of tea, will frequently, comfortably and
  effectually, open the bowels, and will supersede the necessity of taking
  laxative medicine.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Nature's Medicines.</b>&mdash;Now, Nature's
  medicines&mdash;exercise in the open air, occupation, and household
  duties&mdash;on the contrary, not only at the time open the bowels, but
  keep up a proper action for the future; hence their inestimable
  superiority. <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page275"></a>[275]</span></p>

  <p>6. <b>Warm Water Injections.</b>&mdash;An excellent remedy for
  costiveness of pregnancy is an enema, either of warm water, or of Castile
  soap and water, which the patient, by means of a self-injecting
  enema-apparatus, may administer to herself. The quantity of warm water to
  be used, is from half a pint to a pint; the proper heat is the
  temperature of new milk; the time for administering it is early in the
  morning, twice or three times a week.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Muscular Pains of the Abdomen.</b>&mdash;The best remedy is an
  abdominal belt constructed for pregnancy, and adjusted with proper straps
  and buckles to accomodate the gradually increasing size of the womb. This
  plan often affords great comfort and relief; indeed, such a belt is
  indispensably necessary.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Diarrh&oelig;a.</b>&mdash;Although the bowels in pregnancy are
  generally costive, they are sometimes in an opposite state, and are
  relaxed. Now, this relaxation is frequently owing to there having been
  prolonged constipation, and Nature is trying to relieve herself by
  purging. Do not check it, but allow it to have its course, and take a
  little rhubarb or magnesia. The diet should be simple, plain, and
  nourishing, and should consist of beef tea, chicken broth, arrowroot, and
  of well-made and well-boiled oatmeal gruel. Butcher's meat, for a few
  days, should not be eaten; and stimulants of all kinds must be
  avoided.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Fidgets.</b>&mdash;A pregnant lady sometimes suffers severely
  from "fidgets"; it generally affects her feet and legs, especially at
  night, so as to entirely destroy her sleep; she cannot lie still; she
  every few minutes moves, tosses and tumbles about&mdash;first on one
  side, then on the other. The causes of "fidgets" are a heated state of
  the blood; an irritable condition of the nervous system, prevailing at
  that particular time; and want of occupation. The treatment of "fidgets"
  consists of: sleeping in a well-ventilated apartment, with either window
  or door open; a thorough ablution of the whole body every morning, and a
  good washing with tepid water of the face, neck, chest, arms and hands
  every night; shunning hot and close rooms; taking plenty of out-door
  exercise; living on a bland, nourishing, but not rich diet; avoiding meat
  at night, and substituting in lieu thereof, either a cupful of arrow-root
  made with milk, or of well-boiled oatmeal gruel.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;If a lady, during the night, have the
  "fidgets," she should get out of bed; take a short walk up and down the
  room, being well protected by a dressing-gown; empty her bladder; turn
  her pillow, so as to have <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page276"></a>[276]</span>the cold side next the head; and then lie
  down again; and the chances are that she will now fall asleep. If during
  the day she have the "fidgets," a ride in an open carriage; or a stroll
  in the garden, or in the fields; or a little housewifery, will do her
  good, and there is nothing like fresh air, exercise, and occupation to
  drive away "the fidgets."</p>

  <p>11. <b>Heartburn.</b>&mdash;Heartburn is a common and often a
  distressing symptom of pregnancy. The acid producing the heartburn is
  frequently much increased by an overloaded stomach. An abstemious diet
  ought to be strictly observed. Great attention should be paid to the
  quality of the food. Greens, pastry, hot buttered toast, melted butter,
  and everything that is rich and gross, ought to be carefully avoided.
  Either a teaspoonful of heavy calcined magnesia, or half a teaspoonful of
  carbonate of soda&mdash;the former to be preferred if there be
  constipation&mdash;should occasionally be taken in a wine-glassful of
  warm water. If these do not relieve&mdash;the above directions as to diet
  having been strictly attended to&mdash;the following mixture ought to be
  tried. Take of:</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Carbonate of Ammonia, half a drachm;</p>
      <p>Bicarbonate of Soda, a drachm and a half;</p>
      <p>Water, eight ounces;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To make a mixture: Two tablespoonfuls to be taken twice or three times
  a day, until relief be obtained.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Wind in the Stomach and Bowels.</b>&mdash;This is a frequent
  reason why a pregnant lady cannot sleep at night. The two most frequent
  causes of flatulence are, first, the want of walking exercise during the
  day, and second, the eating of a hearty meal just before going to bed at
  night. The remedies are, of course, in each instance, self-evident.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Swollen Legs from Enlarged Veins (Varicose
  Veins.)</b>&mdash;The veins are frequently much enlarged and distended,
  causing the legs to be greatly swollen and very painful, preventing the
  patient from taking proper walking exercise. Swollen legs are owing to
  the pressure of the womb upon the blood-vessels above. Women who have had
  large families are more liable than others to varicose veins. If a lady
  marry late in life, or if she be very heavy in pregnancy&mdash;carrying
  the child low down&mdash;she is more likely to have distention of the
  veins. The best plan will be for her to wear during the day an elastic
  stocking, which ought to be made on purpose for her, in order that it may
  properly fit the leg and foot.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Stretching of the Skin of the Abdomen.</b>&mdash;This is
  frequently, in a first pregnancy, distressing, from the <!-- Page 277
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>[277]</span>soreness it
  causes. The best remedy is to rub the abdomen, every night and morning,
  with warm camphorated oil, and to wear a belt during the day and a broad
  flannel bandage at night, both of which should be put on moderately but
  comfortably tight. The belt must be secured in its situation by means of
  properly adjusted straps.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Before the Approach of Labor.</b>&mdash;The patient, before the
  approach of labor, ought to take particular care to have the bowels
  gently opened, as during that state a costive state greatly increases her
  sufferings, and lengthens the period of her labor. A gentle action is all
  that is necessary; a violent one would do more harm than good.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Swollen and Painful Breasts.</b>&mdash;The breasts are, at
  times, during pregnancy, much swollen and very painful and, now and then,
  they cause the patient great uneasiness as she fancies that she is going
  to have either some dreadful tumor or a gathering of the bosom. There
  need, in such a case, be no apprehension. The swelling and the pain are
  the consequences of the pregnancy, and will in due time subside without
  any unpleasant result. For treatment she cannot do better than rub them
  well, every night and morning, with equal parts of Eau de Cologne and
  olive oil, and wear a piece of new flannel over them; taking care to
  cover the nipples with soft linen, as the friction of the flannel might
  irritate them.</p>

  <p>17. <b>Bowel Complaints.</b>&mdash;Bowel complaints, during pregnancy,
  are not unfrequent. A dose either of rhubarb and magnesia, or of castor
  oil, are the best remedies, and are generally, in the way of medicine,
  all that is necessary.</p>

  <p>17. <b>Cramps.</b>&mdash;Cramps of the legs and of the thighs during
  the latter period, and especially at night, are apt to attend pregnancy,
  and are caused by the womb pressing upon the nerves which extend to the
  lower extremities. Treatment.&mdash;Tightly tie a handkerchief, folded
  like a neckerchief, round the limb a little above the part affected, and
  let it remain on for a few minutes. Friction by means of the hand either
  with opodeldoc or with laudanum, taking care not to drink the lotion by
  mistake, will also give relief.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs279.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/279.jpg"
      alt="A precious flower." title="A precious flower." /></a>
    A PRECIOUS FLOWER.
  </div>
  <p>19. <b>The Whites.</b>&mdash;The whites during pregnancy, especially
  during the latter months, and particularly if the lady have had many
  children, are frequently troublesome, and are, in a measure, occasioned
  by the pressure of the womb on the parts below, causing irritation. The
  best way, therefore, to obviate such pressure is for the patient to lie
  down a great part of each day either on a bed or a sofa. She ought to
  retire early to rest; she should sleep on a hard <!-- Page 279 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page279"></a>[279]</span>mattress and in a
  well-ventilated apartment, and should not overload her bed with clothes.
  A thick, heavy quilt at these times, and indeed at all times, is
  particularly objectionable; the perspiration cannot pass readily through
  it as through blankets, and thus she is weakened. She ought to live on
  plain, wholesome, nourishing food; and she must abstain from beer and
  wine and spirits. The bowels ought to be gently opened by means of a
  Seidlitz powder, which should occasionally be taken early in the
  morning.</p>

  <p>20. <b>Irritation and Itching of the External Parts.</b>&mdash;This a
  most troublesome affection, and may occur at any time, but more
  especially during the latter period of the pregnancy. Let her diet be
  simple and nourishing; let her avoid stimulants of all kinds. Let her
  take a sitz-bath of warm water, considerably salted. Let her sit in the
  bath with the body thoroughly covered.</p>

  <p>21. <b>Hot and inflamed.</b>&mdash;The external parts, and the passage
  to the womb (vagina), in these cases, are not only irritable and itching,
  but are sometimes hot and inflamed, and are covered either with small
  pimples, or with a whitish exudation of the nature of aphtha (thrush),
  somewhat similar to the thrush on the mouth of an infant; then, the
  addition of glycerine to the lotion is a great improvement and usually
  gives much relief.</p>

  <p>22. <a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a><b>Biliousness</b>
  is defined by some one as piggishness. Generally it may be regarded as
  <i>overfed</i>. The elements of the bile are in the blood in excess of
  the power of the liver to eliminate them. This may be caused either from
  the superabundance of the materials from which the bile is made or by
  inaction of the organ itself. Being thus retained the system is
  <i>clogged</i>. It is the result of either too much food in quantity or
  too rich in quality. Especially is it caused by the excessive use of
  <i>fats and sweets</i>. The simplest remedy is the best. A plain, light
  diet with plenty of acid fruits, avoiding fats and sweets, will
  ameliorate or remove it. Don't force the appetite. Let hunger demand
  food. In the morning the sensitiveness of the stomach may be relieved by
  taking before rising a cup of hot water, hot milk, hot lemonade, rice or
  barley water, selecting according to preference. For this purpose many
  find coffee made from browned wheat or corn the best drink. Depend for a
  time upon liquid food that can be taken up by absorbents. The juice of
  lemons and other acid fruits is usually grateful, and <!-- Page 280
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>[280]</span>assists in
  assimilating any excess in nutriment. These may be diluted according to
  taste. With many, an egg lemonade proves relishing and acceptable.</p>

  <p>23. <b>Deranged Appetite.</b>&mdash;Where the appetite fails, let the
  patient go without eating for a little while, say for two or three meals.
  If, however, the strength begins to go, try the offering of some
  unexpected delicacy; or give small quantities of nourishing food, as
  directed in case of morning sickness.</p>

  <p>24. <b>Piles.</b>&mdash;For cases of significance consult a physician.
  As with constipation, so with piles, its frequent result, fruit diet,
  exercise, and sitz-bath regimen will do much to prevent the trouble.
  Frequent local applications of a cold compress, and even of ice, and
  tepid water injections, are of great service. Walking or standing
  aggravate this complaint. Lying down alleviates it. Dr. Shaw says, "There
  is nothing in the world that will produce so great relief in piles as
  fasting. If the fit is severe, live a whole day, or even two, if
  necessary, upon pure soft cold water alone. Give then very lightly of
  vegetable food."</p>

  <p>25. <b>Toothache.</b>&mdash;There is a sort of proverb that a woman
  loses one tooth every time she has a child. Neuralgic toothache during
  pregnancy is, at any rate, extremely common, and often has to be endured.
  It is generally thought not best to have teeth extracted during
  pregnancy, as the shock to the nervous system has sometimes caused
  miscarriage. To wash out the mouth morning and night with cold or
  lukewarm water and salt is often of use. If the teeth are decayed,
  consult a good dentist in the early stages of pregnancy, and have the
  offending teeth properly dressed. Good dentists, in the present state of
  the science, extract very few teeth, but save them.</p>

  <p>26. <b>Salivation.</b>&mdash;Excessive secretion of the saliva has
  usually been reckoned substantially incurable. Fasting, cold water
  treatment, exercise and fruit diet may be relied on to prevent, cure or
  alleviate it, where this is possible, as it frequently is.</p>

  <p>27. <b>Headache.</b>&mdash;This is, perhaps, almost as common in cases
  of pregnancy as "morning sickness." It may be from determination of blood
  to the head, from constipation or indigestion, constitutional "sick
  headache," from neuralgia, from a cold, from rheumatism. Correct living
  will prevent much headache trouble; and where this does not answer the
  purpose, rubbing and making magnetic passes over the <!-- Page 281
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>[281]</span>head by the
  hand of some healthy magnetic person will often prove of great
  service.</p>

  <p>28. <b>Liver-Spots.</b>&mdash;These, on the face, must probably be
  endured, as no trustworthy way of driving them off is known.</p>

  <p>29. <b>Jaundice.</b>&mdash;See the doctor.</p>

  <p>30. <b>Pain on the Right Side.</b>&mdash;This is liable to occur from
  about the fifth to the eighth month, and is attributed to the pressure of
  the enlarging womb upon the liver. Proper living is most likely to
  alleviate it. Wearing a wet girdle in daytime or a wet compress at night,
  sitz-baths, and friction with the wet hand may also be tried. If the pain
  is severe a mustard poultice may be used. Exercise should be carefully
  moderated if found to increase the pain. If there is fever and
  inflammation with it, consult a physician. It is usually not dangerous,
  but uncomfortable only.</p>

  <p>31. <b>Palpitation of the Heart.</b>&mdash;To be prevented by healthy
  living and calm, good humor. Lying down will often gradually relieve it,
  so will a compress wet with water, as hot as can be borne, placed over
  the heart and renewed as often as it gets cool.</p>

  <p>32. <b>Fainting.</b>&mdash;Most likely to be caused by "quickening,"
  or else by tight dress, bad air, over-exertion, or other unhealthy
  living. It is not often dangerous. Lay the patient in an easy posture,
  the head rather low than high, and where cool air may blow across the
  face; loosen the dress if tight; sprinkle cold water on the face and
  hands.</p>

  <p>33. <b>Sleeplessness.</b>&mdash;Most likely to be caused by incorrect
  living, and to be prevented and cured by the opposite. A glass or two of
  cold water drank deliberately on going to bed often helps one to go to
  sleep; so does bathing the face and hands and the feet in cold water. A
  short nap in the latter part of the forenoon can sometimes be had, and is
  of use. Such a nap ought not to be too long, or it leaves a heavy
  feeling; it should be sought with the mind in a calm state, in a
  well-ventilated though darkened room, and with the clothing removed, as
  at night. A similar nap in the afternoon is not so good, but is better
  than nothing. The tepid sitz-bath on going to bed will often produce
  sleep, and so will gentle percussion given by an attendant with palms of
  the hand over the back for a few minutes on retiring. To secure sound
  sleep do not read, write or severely tax the mind in the evening. <!--

<h2>MORNING SICKNESS.</h2>

  <p>1. A pregnant woman is especially liable to suffer many forms of
  dyspepsia, nervous troubles, sleeplessness, etc.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Morning Sickness</b> is the most common and is the result of an
  irritation in the womb, caused by some derangement, and it is greatly
  irritated by the habit of indulging in sexual gratification during
  pregnancy. If people would imitate the lower animals and reserve the
  vital forces of the mother for the benefit of her unborn child, it would
  be a great boon to humanity. Morning sickness may begin the next day
  after conception, but it usually appears from two to three weeks after
  the beginning of pregnancy and continues with more or less severity from
  two to four months.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Home Treatment for Morning Sickness.</b>&mdash;Avoid all highly
  seasoned and rich food. Also avoid strong tea and coffee. Eat especially
  light and simple suppers at five o'clock and no later than six. Some
  simple broths, such as will be found in the cooking department of this
  book will be very nourishing and soothing. Coffee made from brown wheat
  or corn is an excellent remedy to use. The juice of lemons reduced with
  water will sometimes prove very effectual. A good lemonade with an egg
  well stirred is very nourishing and toning to the stomach.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Hot Fomentation</b> on the stomach and liver is excellent, and
  warm and hot water injections are highly beneficial.</p>

  <p>5. A little powdered magnesia at bed time, taken in a little milk,
  will often give almost permanent relief.</p>

  <p>6. Avoid corsets or any other pressure upon the stomach. All garments
  must be worn loosely. In many cases this will entirely prevent all
  stomach disturbances.</p>

<h2>Relation of Husband and Wife During
Pregnancy.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Miscarriage.</b>&mdash;If the wife is subject to miscarriage
  every precaution should be employed to prevent its happening again. Under
  such exceptional circumstances the husband should sleep apart the first
  five months of pregnancy; after that length of time, the ordinary
  relation may be assumed. If miscarriage has taken place, intercourse
  should be avoided for a month or six weeks at least after the
  accident.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Impregnation</b>&mdash;Impregnation is the only mission of
  intercourse, and after that has taken place, intercourse can subserve no
  other purpose than sensual gratification.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Woman Must Judge.</b>&mdash;Every man should recognize the fact
  that woman is the sole umpire as to when, how frequent, and under what
  circumstances, connection should take place. Her desires should not be
  ignored, for her likes and dislikes are&mdash;as seen in another part of
  this book&mdash;easily impressed upon the unborn child. If she is strong
  and healthy there is no reason why passion should not be gratified with
  moderation and caution during the whole period of pregnancy, but she must
  be the sole judge and her desires supreme.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Voluntary Instances.</b>&mdash;No voluntary instances occur
  through the entire animal kingdom. All females repel with force and
  fierceness the approaches of the male. The human family is the only
  exception. A man that loves his wife, however, will respect her under all
  circumstances and recognize her condition and yield to her wishes.</p>

<h2>A Private Word to the Expectant Mother</h2>

      alt="The Expectant Mother." title="The Expectant Mother." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Elizabeth Cady Stanton, in a lecture to ladies, thus strongly states
  her views regarding maternity and painless childbirth:</p>

  <p>"We must educate our daughters to think that motherhood is grand, and
  that God never cursed it. And this curse, if it be a curse, may be rolled
  off, as man has rolled away the curse of labor; as the curse has been
  rolled from the descendants of Ham. My mission is to preach this new
  gospel. If you suffer, it is not because you are cursed of God, but
  because you violate His laws. What an incubus it would take from woman
  could she be educated to know that the pains of maternity are no curse
  upon her kind. We know that among the Indians the squaws do not suffer in
  childbirth. They will step aside from the ranks, even on the march, and
  return in a short time to them with the newborn child. What an absurdity
  then, to suppose that only enlightened Christian women are cursed. But
  one word of fact is worth a volume of philosophy; let me give you some of
  my own experience. I am the mother of seven children. My girlhood was
  spent mostly in the open air. I early imbibed the idea that a girl was
  just as good as a boy, and I carried it out. I would walk five miles
  before breakfast or <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page285"></a>[285]</span>ride ten on horseback. After I was married
  I wore my clothing sensibly. Their weight hung entirely on my shoulders.
  I never compressed my body out of its natural shape. When my first four
  children were born, I suffered very little. I then made up my mind that
  it was totally unnecessary for me to suffer at all; so I dressed lightly,
  walked every day, lived as much as possible in the open air, ate no
  condiments or spices, kept quiet, listened to music, looked at pictures,
  and took proper care of myself. The night before the birth of the child I
  walked three miles. The child was born without a particle of pain. I
  bathed it and dressed it, and it weighed ten and one-half pounds. That
  same day I dined with the family. Everybody said I would surely die, but
  I never had a relapse or a moment's inconvenience from it. I know this is
  not being delicate and refined, but if you would be vigorous and healthy,
  in spite of the diseases of your ancestors, and your own disregard of
  nature's laws, try it."</p>

<h2>Shall Pregnant Women Work?</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Over-worked Mothers.</b>&mdash;Children born of over-worked
  mothers, are liable <span class="correction" title="text reads `to a be'"
  >to be a</span> dwarfed and puny race. However, their chances are better
  than those of the children of inactive, dependent, indolent mothers who
  have neither brain nor muscle to transmit to son or daughter. The truth
  seems to be that excessive labor, with either body or mind, is alike
  injurious to both men and women, and herein lies the sting of that old
  curse. This paragraph suggests all that need be said on the question
  whether pregnant women should or should not labor.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Foolishly Idle.</b>&mdash;At least it is certain that they
  should not be foolishly idle; and on the other hand, it is equally
  certain that they should be relieved from painful laborious occupations
  that exhaust and unfit them for happiness. Pleasant and useful physical
  and intellectual occupation, however, will not only do no harm, but
  positive good.</p>

  <p>3. <b>The Best Man and the Best Woman.</b>&mdash;The best man is he
  who can rear the best child, and the best woman is she who can rear the
  best child. We very properly extol to the skies Harriet Hosmer, the
  artist, for cutting in marble the statue of a Zenobia, how much more
  should we sing praises to the man and the woman who bring into the world
  a noble boy or girl. The one is a piece of lifeless beauty, the other a
  piece of life including all beauty, all possibilities.</p>

<h2>Words for Young Mothers.</h2>

  </div>
  <p>The act of nursing is sometimes painful to the mother, especially
  before the habit is fully established. The discomfort is greatly
  increased if the skin that covers the nipples is tender and delicate. The
  suction pulls it off, leaving them in a state in which the necessary
  pressure of the child's lips cause intense agony. This can be prevented
  in a great measure, says Elizabeth Robinson Scovil, in <i>Ladies' Home
  Journal</i>, if not entirely, by bathing the nipples twice a day for six
  weeks before the confinement with powdered alum dissolved in alcohol; or
  salt dissolved in brandy. If there is any symptom of the skin cracking
  when the child begins to nurse, they should be painted with a mixture of
  tannin and glycerine. This must be washed off before the baby touches
  them and renewed when it leaves them. If they are <!-- Page 287 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page287"></a>[287]</span>very painful, the
  doctor will probably order morphia added to the mixture. A rubber nipple
  shield to be put on at the time of nursing, is a great relief. If the
  nipples are retracted or drawn inward, they can be drawn out painlessly
  by filling a pint bottle with boiling water, emptying it and quickly
  applying the mouth over the nipple. As the air in the bottle cools, it
  condenses, leaving a vacuum and the nipple is pushed out by the air
  behind it.</p>

  <p>When the milk accumulates or "cakes" in the breast in hard patches,
  they should be rubbed very gently, from the base upwards, with warm
  camphorated oil. The rubbing should be the lightest, most delicate
  stroking, avoiding pressure. If lumps appear at the base of the breast
  and it is red, swollen and painful, cloths wrung out of cold water should
  be applied and the doctor sent for. While the breast is full and hard all
  over, not much apprehension need be felt. It is when lumps appear that
  the physician should be notified, that he may, if possible, prevent the
  formation of abscesses.</p>

  <p>While a woman is nursing she should eat plenty of nourishing
  food&mdash;milk, oatmeal, cracked wheat, and good juicy, fresh meat,
  boiled, roasted, or broiled, but not fried. Between each meal, before
  going to bed, and once during the night, she should take a cup of cocoa,
  gruel made with milk, good beef tea, mutton broth, or any warm, nutritive
  drink. Tea and coffee are to be avoided. It is important to keep the
  digestion in order and the bowels should be carefully regulated as a
  means to this end. If necessary, any of the laxative mineral waters can
  be used for this purpose, or a teaspoonful of compound licorice powder
  taken at night. Powerful cathartic medicines should be avoided because of
  their effect upon the baby. The child should be weaned at nine months
  old, unless this time comes in very hot weather, or the infant is so
  delicate that a change of food would be injurious. If the mother is not
  strong her nurseling will sometimes thrive better upon artificial food
  than on its natural nourishment. By gradually lengthening the interval
  between the nursing and feeding the child, when it is hungry, the weaning
  can be accomplished without much trouble.</p>

  <p>A young mother should wear warm underclothing, thick stockings and a
  flannel jacket over her night dress, unless she is in the habit of
  wearing an under vest. If the body is not protected by warm clothing
  there is an undue demand upon the nervous energy to keep up the vital
  heat, and nerve force is wasted by the attempt to compel the system to do
  what ought to be done for it by outside means.</p>

<h2>How to Have Beautiful Children.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs289.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/289.jpg"
      alt="Baby." title="Baby." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Parental Influence.</b>&mdash;The art of having handsome
  children has been a question that has interested the people of all ages
  and of all nationalities. There is no longer a question as to the
  influence that parents may and do exert upon their offspring, and it is
  shown in other parts of this book that beauty depends largely on the
  condition of health at the time of conception. It is therefore of no
  little moment that parents should guard carefully their own health as
  well as that of their children, that they may develop a vigorous
  constitution. There cannot be beauty without good health.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Marrying Too Early.</b>&mdash;We know that marriage at too early
  an age, or too late in life, is apt to produce imperfectly <!-- Page 289
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>[289]</span>developed
  children, both mentally and physically. The causes are self-evident: A
  couple marrying too young, they lack maturity and consequently will
  impart weakness to their offspring; while on the other hand persons
  marrying late in life fail to find that normal condition which is
  conducive to the health and vigor of offspring.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Crossing of Temperaments and Nationalities.</b>&mdash;The
  crossing of temperaments and nationalities beautifies offspring. If young
  persons of different nationalities marry, their children under proper
  hygienic laws are generally handsome and healthy. For instance, an
  American and German or an Irish and German uniting in marriage, produces
  better looking children than those marrying in the same nationality.
  Persons of different temperaments uniting in marriage, always produces a
  good effect upon offspring.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Proper Time.</b>&mdash;To obtain the best results,
  conception should take place only when both parties are in the best
  physical condition. If either parent is in any way indisposed at the time
  of conception the results will be seen in the health of the child. Many
  children brought in the world with diseases or other infirmities stamped
  upon their feeble frames show the indiscretion and ignorance of
  parents.</p>

  <p>5. <b>During Pregnancy.</b>&mdash;During pregnancy the mother should
  take time for self improvement and cultivate an interest for admiring
  beautiful pictures or engravings which represent cheerful and beautiful
  figures. Secure a few good books illustrating art, with some fine
  representations of statues and other attractive pictures. The purchase of
  several illustrated art journals might answer the purpose.</p>

  <p>6. <b>What to Avoid.</b>&mdash;Pregnant mothers should avoid thinking
  of ugly people, or those marked by any deformity or disease; avoid
  injury, fright and disease of any kind. Also avoid ungraceful position
  and awkward attitude, but cultivate grace and beauty in herself. Avoid
  difficulty with neighbors or other trouble.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Good Care.</b>&mdash;She should keep herself in good physical
  condition, and the system well nourished, as a want of food always
  injures the child.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Improvement of the Mind.</b>&mdash;The mother should read
  suitable articles in newspapers or good books, keep her mind occupied. If
  she cultivates a desire for intellectual improvement, the same desire
  will be more or less manifested in the growth and development of the
  child. <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  conditions&mdash;in tendencies of thought and in habits of action. Let
  this grand truth be deeply impressed upon the hearts of all who desire or
  expect to become parents.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Heredity.</b>&mdash;Male children generally inherit the
  peculiar traits and diseases of the mother and female children those of
  the father.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Advice.</b>&mdash;"Therefore it is urged that during the period
  of utero-gestation, especial pains should be taken to render the life of
  the female as harmonious as possible, that her surroundings should all be
  of a nature calculated to inspire the mind with thoughts of physical and
  mental beauties and perfections, and that she should be guarded against
  all influences, of whatever character, having a deteriorating
  tendency."</p>

<h2>Education of the Child in the Womb.</h2>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A lady once interviewed a prominent college president and asked him
  when the education of a child should begin. 'Twenty-five years before it
  is born,' was the prompt reply."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>No better answer was ever given to that question. Every mother may
  well consider it.</p>

    THE BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>The Unborn Child Affected by the Thoughts and the Surroundings
  of the Mother.</b>&mdash;That the child is affected in the womb of the
  mother, through the influences apparently connected with objects by which
  she is surrounded, appears to have been well known in ancient days, as
  well as at the present time.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Evidences.</b>&mdash;Many evidences are found in ancient
  history, especially among the refined nations, showing that certain
  expedients were resorted to by which their females, during the period of
  utero-gestation, were surrounded by the superior refinements of the age,
  with the hope of thus making upon them impressions which should have the
  effect of communicating certain desired qualities to the offspring. For
  this reason apartments were adorned with statuary and paintings, and
  special pains were taken not only to convey favorable impressions, but
  also to guard against unfavorable ones being made, upon the mind of the
  pregnant woman.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Hankering after Gin.</b>&mdash;A certain mother while pregnant,
  longed for gin, which could not be gotten; and her child cried
  incessantly for six weeks till gin was given it, which it eagerly
  clutched and drank with ravenous greediness, stopped crying, and became
  healthy.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Begin to Educate Children at Conception</b>, and continue during
  their entire carriage. Yet maternal study, of little account before the
  sixth, after it, is most promotive of talents; which, next to goodness
  are the father's joy and the mother's pride. What pains are taken after
  they are born, to render them prodigies of learning, by the best of
  schools and teachers from their third year; whereas their mother's study,
  three months before their birth, would improve their intellects
  infinitely more.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Mothers, Does God Thus Put</b> the endowment of your darlings
  into your moulding power? Then tremble in view of its necessary
  responsibilities, and learn how to wield them for their and your temporal
  and eternal happiness. <!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page293"></a>[293]</span></p>

  <p>6. <b>Qualities of the Mind.</b>&mdash;The qualities of the mind are
  perhaps as much liable to hereditary transmission as bodily
  configuration.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs294.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/294.jpg"
      alt="Baby." title="Baby." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Memory, intelligence, judgment, imagination, passions, diseases, and
  what is usually called genius, are often very markedly traced in the
  offspring.&mdash;I have known mental impressions forcibly impressed upon
  the offspring at the time of conception, as concomitant of some peculiar
  eccentricity, idiosyncracy, morbidness, waywardness, irritability, or
  proclivity of either one or both parents.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Plastic Brain.</b>&mdash;The plastic brain of the
  f&oelig;tus is prompt to receive all impressions. It retains them, and
  they become the characteristics of the child and the man. Low spirits,
  violent passions, irritability, frivolity, in the pregnant woman, leave
  indelible marks on the unborn child.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Formation of Character.</b>&mdash;I believe that pre-natal
  influences may do as much in the formation of character as all the
  education that can come after, and that mothers may, in a measure,
  "will," what that influence shall be, and that, as knowledge on the
  subject increases, it will be more and more under their control. In that,
  as in everything else, things that would be possible with one mother
  would not be with another, and measures that would be successful with one
  would produce opposite results from the other.</p>

  <p>9. <b>A Historical Illustration.</b>&mdash;A woman rode side by side
  with her soldier husband, and witnessed the drilling of troops for
  battle. The scene inspired her with a deep longing to see a battle and
  share in the excitements of the <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page294"></a>[294]</span>conquerors. This was but a few months
  before her boy was born, and his name was Napoleon.</p>

  <p>10. <b>A Musician.</b>&mdash;The following was reported by Dr. F. W.
  Moffatt, in the mother's own language: "When I was first pregnant, I
  wished my offspring to be a musician, so, during the period of that
  pregnancy, settled my whole mind on music, and attended every musical
  entertainment I possibly could. I had my husband, who has a violin, to
  play for me by the hour. When the child was born, it was a girl, which
  grew and prospered, and finally became an expert musician."</p>

  <p>11. <b>Murderous Intent.</b>&mdash;The mother of a young man, who was
  hung not long ago, was heard to say: "I tried to get rid of him before he
  was born; and, oh, how I wish now that I had succeeded!" She added that
  it was the only time she had attempted anything of the sort; but, because
  of home troubles, she became desperate, and resolved that her burdens
  should not be made any greater. Does it not seem probable that the
  murderous intent, even though of short duration, was communicated to the
  mind of the child, and resulted in the crime for which he was hung?</p>

  <p>12. <b>The Assassin of Garfield.</b>&mdash;Guiteau's father was a man
  of integrity and considerable intellectual ability. His children were
  born in quick succession, and the mother was obliged to work very hard.
  Before this child was born, she resorted to every means, though
  unsuccessful, to produce abortion. The world knows the result. Guiteau's
  whole life was full of contradictions. There was little self-controlling
  power in him; no common sense, and not a vestige of remorse or shame. In
  his wild imagination, he believed himself capable of doing the greatest
  work, and of filling the loftiest station in life. Who will dare question
  that this mother's effort to destroy him while in embryo was the main
  cause in bringing him to the level of the brutes?</p>

  <p>13. <b>Caution.</b>&mdash;Any attempt, on the part of the mother, to
  destroy her child before birth, is liable, if unsuccessful, to produce
  murderous tendencies. Even harboring murderous thoughts, whether toward
  her own child or not, might be followed by similar results.</p>

    The Embryo In Sixty Days.
  </div>
  <p>1. The table on the opposite page has been very accurately compiled,
  and will be very helpful to those who desire the exact time.</p>

  <p>2. The duration of pregnancy is from 278 to 280 days, or nearly forty
  weeks. The count should be made from the beginning of the last
  menstruation, and add eight days on account of the possibility of it
  occurring within that period The heavier the child the longer is the
  duration; the younger the woman the longer time it often requires. The
  duration is longer in married than in unmarried women; the duration is
  liable to be longer if the child is a female.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Movement.</b>&mdash;The first movement is generally felt on the
  135th day after impregnation.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Growth of the Embryo.</b>&mdash;About the twentieth day the
  embryo resembles the appearance of an ant or lettuce seed; the 30th day
  the embryo is as large as a common horse fly; the 40th day the form
  resembles that of a person; in sixty days the limbs begin to form, and in
  four months the embryo takes the name of f&oelig;tus.</p>

  <p>5. Children born after seven or eight months can survive and develop
  to maturity.</p>

<hr class="full" >

<p><!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<h2>The Signs and Symptoms of Labor.</h2>

  <p>1. Although the majority of patients, a day or two before the labor
  comes on, are more bright and cheerful, some few are more anxious,
  fanciful, fidgety and reckless.</p>

  <p>2. A few days, sometimes a few hours, before labor commences, the
  child "falls" as it is called; that is to say, there is a
  subsidence&mdash;a dropping&mdash;of the womb lower down the abdomen.
  This is the reason why she feels lighter and more comfortable, and more
  inclined to take exercise, and why she can breathe more freely.</p>

  <p>3. The only inconvenience of the dropping of the womb is, that the
  womb presses more on the bladder, and sometimes causes an irritability of
  that organ, inducing a frequent desire to make water. The wearing the
  obstetric belt, as so particularly enjoined in previous pages, will
  greatly mitigate this inconvenience.</p>

  <p>4. The subsidence&mdash;the dropping&mdash;of the womb may then be
  considered one of the earliest of the precursory symptoms of child-birth,
  and as the herald of the coming event.</p>

  <p>5. She has, at this time, an increased moisture of the
  vagina&mdash;the passage leading to the womb&mdash;and of the external
  parts. She has, at length, slight pains, and then she has a "show," as it
  is called; which is the coming away of a mucous plug which, during
  pregnancy, had hermetically sealed up the mouth of the womb. The "show"
  is generally tinged with a little blood. When a "show" takes place, she
  may rest assured that labor has actually commenced. One of the early
  symptoms of labor is a frequent desire to relieve the bladder.</p>

  <p>6. She ought not, on any account, unless it be ordered by the medical
  man, to take any stimulant as a remedy for the shivering. In case of
  shivering or chills, a cup either of hot tea or of hot gruel will be the
  best remedy for the shivering; and an extra blanket or two should be
  thrown over her, and be well tucked around her, in order to thoroughly
  exclude the air from the body. The extra clothing, as soon as she is warm
  and perspiring, should be gradually removed, as she ought not to be kept
  very hot, or it will weaken her, and will thus retard her labor.</p>

  <p>7. She must not, on any account, force down&mdash;as her female
  friends or as a "pottering" old nurse may advise&mdash;to "grinding
  pains"; if she does, it will rather retard than forward her labor. <!--
  Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"></a>[298]</span></p>

  <p>8. During this stage, she had better walk about or sit down, and not
  confine herself to bed; indeed, there is no necessity for her, unless she
  particularly desire it, to remain in her chamber.</p>

  <p>9. After an uncertain length of time, the pains alter in character.
  From being "grinding" they become "bearing down," and more regular and
  frequent, and the skin becomes both hot and perspiring. These may be
  considered the true labor-pains. The patient ought to bear in mind then
  that "true labor-pains" are situated in the back, and loins; they come on
  at regular intervals, rise gradually up to a certain pitch of intensity,
  and abate as gradually; it is a dull, heavy, deep sort of pain, producing
  occasionally a low moan from the patient; not sharp or twinging, which
  would elicit a very different expression of suffering from her.</p>

  <p>10. Labor&mdash;and truly it maybe called, "labor." The fiat has gone
  forth that in "sorrow thou shalt bring forth children." Young, in his
  "Night Thoughts," beautifully expresses the common lot of women to
  suffer:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>Not more the children than sure heirs of pain."</p>

  </div>
  <p>1. Before the confinement takes place everything should be carefully
  arranged and prepared. The physician should be spoken to and be given the
  time as near as can be calculated. The arrangement of the bed, bed
  clothing, the dress for the mother and the expected babe should be
  arranged for convenient and immediate use.</p>

  <p>2. A bottle of sweet oil, or vaseline, or some pure lard should be in
  readiness. Arrangements should be made for washing all soiled garments,
  and nothing by way of soiled rags or clothing should be allowed to
  accumulate.</p>

  <p>3. A rubber blanket, or oil or waterproof cloth should be in readiness
  to place underneath the bottom sheet to be used during labor.</p>

  <p>4. As soon as labor pains have begun a fire should be built and hot
  water kept ready for immediate use. The room should be kept well
  ventilated and comfortably warm.</p>

  <p>5. No people should be allowed in or about the room except the nurse,
  the physician, and probably members of the family when called upon to
  perform some duty. <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page300"></a>[300]</span></p>

  <p>6. During labor no solid food should be taken; a little milk, broth or
  soup may be given, provided there is an appetite. Malt or spirituous
  liquors should be carefully avoided. A little wine, however, may be taken
  in case of great exhaustion. Lemonade, toast, rice water, and tea may he
  given when desired. Warm tea is considered an excellent drink for the
  patient at this time.</p>

  <p>7. When the pains become regular and intermit, it is time that the
  physician is sent for. On the physician's arrival he will always take
  charge of the case and give necessary instructions.</p>

  <p>8. In nearly all cases the head of the child is presented first. The
  first pains are generally grinding and irregular, and felt mostly in the
  groins and within, but as labor progresses the pains are felt in the
  abdomen, and as the head advances there is severe pain in the back and
  hips and a disposition to bear down, but no pressure should be placed
  upon the abdomen of the patient; it is often the cause of serious
  accidents. Nature will take care of itself.</p>

  <p>9. Conversation should be of a cheerful character, and all allusions
  to accidents of other child births should be carefully avoided.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Absence of Physician.</b>&mdash;In case the child should be
  born in the absence of the physician, when the head is born receive it in
  the hand and support it until the shoulders have been expelled, and
  steady the whole body until the child is born. Support the child with
  both hands and lay it as far from the mother as possible without
  stretching the cord. Remove the mucus from the nostrils and mouth, wrap
  the babe in warm flannel, make the mother comfortable, give her a drink,
  and allow the child to remain until the pulsations in the cord have
  entirely ceased. After the pulsations have entirely ceased then sever the
  cord. Use a dull pair of scissors, cutting it about two inches from the
  child's navel, and generally no <span class="correction" title="text reads `time'"
  >tying</span> is <span class="correction" title="text reads `neeessary'"
  >necessary</span>, and when the physician comes he will give it prompt
  attention.</p>

  <p>11. If the child does not breathe at its arrival, says Dr. Stockham in
  her celebrated Tokology, a little slapping on the breast and body will
  often produce respiration, and if this is not efficient, dash cold water
  on the face and chest; if this fails then close the nostrils with two
  fingers, breathe into the mouth and then expel the air from the lungs by
  gentle pressure upon the chest. Continue this as long as any hope of life
  remains.</p>

  <p>12. <b>After-Birth.</b>&mdash;Usually contractions occur and the
  after-birth is readily expelled; if not, clothes wrung out in <!-- Page
  301 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page301"></a>[301]</span>hot water
  laid upon the bowels will often cause the contraction of the uterus, and
  the expulsion of the after-birth.</p>

  <p>13. If the cord bleeds severely inject cold water into it. This in
  many cases removes the after-birth.</p>

  <p>14. After the birth of the child give the patient a bath, if the
  patient is not too exhausted, change the soiled quilts and clothing, fix
  up everything neat and clean and let the patient rest.</p>

  <p>15. Let the patient drink weak tea, gruel, cold or hot water,
  whichever she chooses.</p>

  <p>16. After the birth of the baby, the mother should be kept perfectly
  quiet for the first 24 hours and not allowed to talk or see anyone except
  her nearest relations, however well she may seem. She should not get out
  of bed for ten days or two weeks, nor sit up in bed for nine days. The
  more care taken of her at this time, the more rapid will be her recovery
  when she does get about. She should go up and down stairs slowly,
  carefully, and as seldom as possible for six weeks. She should not stand
  more than is unavoidable during that time, but sit with her feet up and
  lie down when she has time to rest. She should not work a sewing machine
  with a treadle for at least six weeks, and avoid any unusual strain or
  over-exertion. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," and
  carefulness will be well repaid by a perfect restoration to health.</p>

<h2>Child Bearing Without Pain.</h2>

<h3>HOW TO DRESS, DIET AND EXERCISE IN
PREGNANCY.</h3>

  <p>1. <b>Ailments.</b>&mdash;Those ailments to which pregnant women are
  liable are mostly inconveniences rather than diseases, although they may
  be aggravated to a degree of danger. No patent nostrums or prescriptions
  are necessary. If there is any serious difficulty the family physician
  should be consulted.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Comfort.</b>&mdash;Wealth and luxuries are not a necessity.
  Comfort will make the surroundings pleasant. Drudgery, overwork and
  exposure are the three things that tend to make women miserable while in
  the state of pregnancy, and invariably produce irritable, fretful and
  feeble children. Dr. Stockham says in her admirable work "Tokology": "The
  woman who indulges in the excessive gayety of fashionable life, as well
  as the overworked woman, deprives her child of vitality. She attends
  parties in a dress that is unphysiological in warmth, distribution and
  adjustment, in rooms badly ventilated; partakes of a supper of
  indigestible compounds, and remains into the 'wee, sma' hours,' her
  nervous system taxed to the utmost."</p>

  <p>3. <b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;A goodly amount of moderate exercise is a
  necessity, and a large amount of work may be accomplished if prudence is
  properly exercised. It is overwork, and the want of sufficient rest and
  sleep that produces serious results.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Dresses.</b>&mdash;A pregnant woman should make her dresses of
  light material and avoid surplus trimmings. Do not wear anything that
  produces any unnecessary weight. Let the clothing be light but sufficient
  in quantity to produce comfort in all kinds of weather.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Garments.</b>&mdash;It is well understood that the mother must
  breathe for two, and in order to dress healthily the garments should be
  worn loose, so as to give plenty of room for respiration. Tight clothes
  only cause disease, or produce frailty or malformation in the
  offspring.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Shoes.</b>&mdash;Wear a large shoe in pregnancy; the feet may
  swell and untold discomfort may be the result. Get a good large shoe with
  a large sole. Give the feet plenty of room. Many women suffer from
  defects in vision, indigestion, backache, loss of voice, headache, etc.,
  simply <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page305"></a>[305]</span>as the result of the reflex action of the
  pressure of tight shoes.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Lacing.</b>&mdash;Many women lace themselves in the first period
  of their gestation in order to meet their society engagements. All of
  this is vitally wrong and does great injury to the unborn child as well
  as to inflict many ills and pains upon the mother.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Corsets.</b>&mdash;Corsets should be carefully avoided, for the
  corset more than any other one thing is responsible for making woman the
  victim of more woes and diseases than all other causes put together.
  About one-half the children born in this country die before they are five
  years of age, and no doubt this terrible mortality is largely due to this
  instrument of torture known as the <i>modern corset</i>. Tight lacing is
  the cause of infantile mortality. It slowly but surely takes the lives of
  tens of thousands, and so effectually weakens and diseases, so as to
  cause the untimely death of millions more.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Bathing.</b>&mdash;Next to godliness is cleanliness. A pregnant
  woman should take a sponge or towel-bath two or three times a week. It
  stimulates and invigorates the entire body. No more than two or three
  minutes are required. It should be done in a warm room, and the body
  rubbed thoroughly after each bathing.</p>

  <p>10. <b>The Hot Sitz-Bath.</b>&mdash;This bath is one of the most
  desirable and healthful baths for pregnant women. It will relieve pain or
  acute inflammation, and will be a general tonic in keeping the system in
  a good condition. This may be taken in the middle of the forenoon or just
  before retiring, and if taken just before retiring will produce
  invigorating sleep, will quiet the nerves, cure headache, weariness, etc.
  It is a good plan to take this bath every night before retiring in case
  of any disorders. A woman who keeps this up during the period of
  gestation will have a very easy labor and a strong, vigorous babe.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Hot Fomentations.</b>&mdash;Applying flannel cloths wrung out
  of simple or medicated hot water is a great relief for acute suffering,
  such as neuralgia, rheumatic pain, biliousness, constipation, torpid
  liver, colic, flatulency, etc.</p>

  <p>12. <b>The Hot Water-Bag.</b>&mdash;The hot water-bag serves the same
  purpose as hot fomentations, and is much more convenient. No one should
  go through the period of gestation without a hot water-bag.</p>

  <p>13. <b>The Cold Compress.</b>&mdash;This is a very desirable and
  effectual domestic remedy. Take a towel wrung from cold water and apply
  it to the affected parts; then cover well <!-- Page 306 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>[306]</span>with several
  thicknesses of flannel. This is excellent in cases of sore throat,
  hoarseness, bronchitis, inflammation of the lungs, croup, etc. It is also
  excellent for indigestion, constipation or distress of the bowels
  accompanied by heat.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Diet.</b>&mdash;The pregnant woman should eat nutritious, but
  not stimulating or heating food, and eat at the regular time. Avoid
  drinking much while eating.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Avoid</b> salt, pepper and sweets as much as possible.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Eat</b> all kinds of grains, vegetables and fruits, and avoid
  salted meat, but eat chicken, steak, fish, oysters, etc.</p>

  <p>17. <b>The Woman Who Eats Indiscriminately</b> anything and everything
  the same as any other person, will have a very painful labor and suffer
  many ills that could easily be avoided by more attention being paid to
  the diet. With a little study and observation a woman will soon learn
  what to eat and what to avoid.</p>

  <p>18. The above cuts are given on page <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `113', incorrectly">105</span>; we repeat them here for
  the benefit of expectant mothers who may be ignorant of the evil effects
  of the corset. <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page307"></a>[307]</span></p>

  <p>Displacement of the womb, interior irritation and inflammation,
  miscarriage and sterility, are some of the many injuries of tight lacing.
  There are many others, in fact their name is legion, and every woman who
  has habitually worn a corset and continues to wear it during the early
  period of gestation must suffer severely during childbirth.</p>

  </div>
<p><!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308"></a>[308]</span></p>

  <p>19. <b>This is what Dr. Stockham</b> says: "If women had <i>common
  sense</i>, instead of <i>fashion sense</i>, the corset would not exist.
  There are not words in the English language to express my convictions
  upon this subject. The corset more than any other one thing is
  responsible for woman's being the victim of disease and doctors....</p>

  <p>"What is the effect upon the child? One-half of the children born in
  this country die before they are five years of age. Who can tell how much
  this state of things is due to the enervation of maternal life forces by
  the one instrument of torture?</p>

  <p>"I am a temperance woman. No one can realize more than I the
  devastation and ruin alcohol in its many tempting forms has brought to
  the human family. Still I solemnly believe that in weakness and
  deterioration of health, the corset has more to answer for than
  intoxicating drinks." When asked how far advanced a woman should be in
  pregnancy before she laid aside her corset, Dr. Stockham said with
  emphasis: "<i>The corset should not be worn for two hundred years before
  pregnancy takes place.</i> Ladies, it will take that time at least to
  overcome the ill-effect of tight garments which you think so
  essential."</p>

  <p>20. <b>Painless Pregnancy and Child-Birth.</b>&mdash;"Some excellent
  popular volumes," says Dr. Haff, "have been largely devoted to directions
  how to secure a comfortable period of pregnancy and painless delivery.
  After much conning of these worthy efforts to impress a little common
  sense upon the sisterhood, we are convinced that all may be summed up
  under the simple heads of: (1) An unconfined and lightly burdened waist;
  (2) Moderate but persistent outdoor exercise, of which walking is the
  best form; (3) A plain, unstimulating, chiefly fruit and vegetable diet;
  (4) Little or no intercourse during the time.</p>

  <p>"These are hygienic rules of benefit under any ordinary conditions;
  yet they are violated by almost every pregnant lady. If they are
  followed, biliousness, indigestion, constipation, swollen limbs, morning
  sickness and nausea&mdash;all will absent themselves or be much lessened.
  In pregnancy, more than at any other time, corsets are injurious. The
  waist and abdomen must be allowed to expand freely with the growth of the
  child. The great process of <i>evolution</i> must have room."</p>

  <p>21. <b>In Addition</b>, we can do no better than quote the following
  recapitulation by Dr. Stockham in her famous <!-- Page 309 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page309"></a>[309]</span>Tokology: "To give a
  woman the greatest immunity from suffering during pregnancy, prepare her
  for a safe and comparatively easy delivery, and insure a speedy recovery,
  all hygienic conditions must be observed.</p>

  <p>"The dress must give:</p>

  <p>"1. Freedom of movement;</p>

  <p>"2. No pressure upon any part of the body;</p>

  <p>"3. No more weight than is essential for warmth, and both weight and
  warmth evenly distributed.</p>

  <p>"These requirements necessitate looseness, lightness and warmth, which
  can be obtained from the union underclothes, a princess skirt and dress,
  with a shoe that allows full development and use of the foot. While
  decoration and elegance are desirable, they should not sacrifice comfort
  and convenience.</p>

  <p>22. <b>"Let the Diet Be Light</b>, plain and nutritious. Avoid fats
  and sweets, relying mainly upon fruits and grain that contain little of
  the mineral salts. By this diet bilious and inflammatory conditions are
  overcome, the development of bone in the f&oelig;tus lessened, and
  muscles necessary in labor nourished and strengthened.</p>

  <p>23. <b>"Exercise</b> should be sufficient and of such a character as
  will bring into action gently every muscle of the body; but must
  particularly develop the muscles of the trunk, abdomen and groin, that
  are specially called into action in labor. Exercise, taken faithfully and
  systematically, more than any other means assists assimilative processes
  and stimulates the organs of excretion to healthy action.</p>

  <p>24. <b>"Bathing Must Be Frequent</b> and regular. Unless in special
  conditions the best results are obtained from tepid or cold bathing,
  which invigorates the system and overcomes nervousness. The sitz-bath is
  the best therapeutic and hygienic measure within the reach of the
  pregnant woman.</p>

  <p>"Therefore, to establish conditions which will overcome many previous
  infractions of law, <i>dress</i> naturally and physiologically;
  <i>live</i> much of the time <i>out of doors</i>; have <i>abundance</i>
  of <i>fresh air</i> in the house; let <i>exercise</i> be
  <i>sufficient</i> and <i>systematic</i>; pursue a <i>diet of fruit</i>,
  rice and vegetables; <i>regular rest</i> must be faithfully taken;
  <i>abstain</i> from the sexual relation. To those who will commit
  themselves to this course of life, patiently and persistently carrying it
  out through the period of gestation, the possibilities of attaining a
  healthy, natural, painless parturition will be remarkably increased. <!--
  Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>[310]</span></p>

  <p>25. <b>"If the First Experiment</b> should not result in a painless
  labor, it without doubt will prove the beginning of sound health.
  Persisted in through years of married life, the ultimate result will be
  more and more closely approximated, while there will be less danger of
  diseases after childbirth and better and more vigorous children will be
  produced.</p>

  <p>"Then pregnancy by every true woman will be desired, and instead of
  being a period of disease, suffering and direful forebodings, will become
  a period of health, exalted pleasure and holiest anticipations.
  Motherhood will be deemed the choicest of earth's blessings; women will
  rejoice in a glad maternity and for any self-denial will be compensated
  by healthy, happy, buoyant, grateful children."</p>

    JOAN OF ARC.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Excessive Pleasures and Pains.</b>&mdash;A woman during her time
  of pregnancy should of all women be most carefully tended, and kept from
  violent and excessive pleasures and pains; and at that time she should
  cultivate gentleness, benevolence and kindness. <!-- Page 313 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>[313]</span></p>

  <p>2. <b>Hereditary Effects.</b>&mdash;Those who are born to become
  insane do not necessarily spring from insane parents, or from any
  ancestry having any apparent taint of lunacy in their blood, but they do
  receive from their progenitors certain impressions upon their mental and
  moral, as well as their physical beings, which impressions, like an iron
  mould, fix and shape their subsequent destinies. Hysteria in the mother
  may develop insanity in the child, while drunkenness in the father may
  impel epilepsy, or mania, in the son. Ungoverned passions in the parents
  may unloose the furies of unrestrained madness in the minds of their
  children, and the bad treatment of the wife may produce sickly or
  weak-minded children.</p>

  <p>3. <b>The influence of predominant passion</b> may be transmitted from
  the parent to the child, just as surely as similarity of looks. It has
  been truly said that "the faculties which predominate in power and
  activity in the parents, when the organic existence of the child
  commences, determine its future mental disposition." A bad mental
  condition of the mother may produce serious defects upon her unborn
  child.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The singular effects</b> produced on the unborn child by the
  sudden mental emotions of the mother are remarkable examples of a kind of
  electrotyping on the sensitive surfaces of living forms. It is doubtless
  true that the mind's action in such cases may increase or diminish the
  molecular deposits in the several portions of the system. The precise
  place which each separate particle assumes in the new organic structure
  may be determined by the influence of thought or feeling. Perfect love
  and perfect harmony should exist between wife and husband during this
  vital period.</p>

  <p>5. <b>An Illustration.</b>&mdash;If a sudden and powerful emotion of a
  woman's mind exerts such an influence upon her stomach as to excite
  vomiting, and upon her heart as almost to arrest its motion and induce
  fainting, can we believe that it will have no effect upon her womb and
  the fragile being contained within it? Facts and reason then, alike
  demonstrate the reality of the influence, and much practical advantage
  would result to both parent and child, were the conditions and extent of
  its operations better understood.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Pregnant women</b> should not be exposed to causes likely to
  distress or otherwise strongly impress their minds. A consistent life
  with worthy objects constantly kept in mind should be the aim and purpose
  of every expectant mother. <!-- Page 314 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<h3>CASES CITED.</h3>

  <p>We selected only a few cases to illustrate the above statement.
  Thousands of cases occur every year that might be cited to illustrate
  these principles. A mother cannot be too careful, and she should have the
  hearty co-operation and assistance of her husband. We quote the following
  cases from Dr. Pancoast's Medical Guide, who is no doubt one of the best
  authorities on the subject.</p>

  <p>1. A woman bitten on the vulva by a dog, bore a child having a similar
  wound on the glans penis. The boy suffered from epilepsy, and when the
  fit came on, or during sleep, was frequently heard to cry out, "The dog
  bites me!"</p>

  <p>2. A pregnant woman who was suddenly alarmed from seeing her husband
  come home with one side of his face swollen and distorted by a blow, bore
  a girl with a purple swelling upon the same side of the face.</p>

  <p>3. A woman, who was forced to be present at the opening of a calf by a
  butcher, bore a child with all its bowels protruding from the abdomen.
  She was aware at the time of something going on within the womb.</p>

  <p>4. A pregnant woman fell into a violent passion at not being able to
  procure a particular piece of meat of a butcher; she bled at the nose,
  and wiping the blood from her lips, bore a child wanting a lip.</p>

  <p>5. A woman absent from home became alarmed by seeing a great fire in
  the direction of her own house, bore a child with a distinct mark of the
  flame upon its forehead.</p>

  <p>6. A woman who had borne healthy children, became frightened by a
  beggar with a wooden leg and a stumped arm, who threatened to embrace
  her. Her next child had one stump leg and two stump arms.</p>

  <p>7. A woman frightened in her first pregnancy by the sight of a child
  with a hare lip, had a child with a deformity of the same kind. Her
  second child had a deep slit, and the third a mark of a similar character
  or modified hare lips. In this instance the morbid mind of the mother
  affected several successive issues of her body.</p>

  <p>8. A pregnant woman became frightened at a lizard jumping into her
  bosom. She bore a child with a fleshy excrescence exactly resembling a
  lizard, growing from the breast, adhering by the head and neck.</p>

  </div>
  <p>1. The first thing to be done ordinarily is to give the little
  stranger a bath by using soap and warm water. To remove the white
  material that usually covers the child use olive oil, goose oil or lard,
  and apply it with a soft piece of worn flannel, and when the child is
  entirely clean rub all off with a fresh piece of flannel.</p>

  <p>2. Many physicians in the United States recommend a thorough oiling of
  the child with pure lard or olive oil, and then rub dry as above stated.
  By these means water is avoided, and with it much risk of taking
  cold.</p>

  <p>3. The application of brandy or liquor is entirely unnecessary, and
  generally does more injury than good. <!-- Page 316 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>[316]</span></p>

  <p>4. If an infant should breathe feebly, or exhibit other signs of great
  feebleness, it should not be washed at once, but allowed to remain quiet
  and undisturbed, warmly wrapped up until the vital actions have acquired
  a fair degree of activity.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Dressing the Navel.</b>&mdash;There is nothing better for
  dressing the navel than absorbent antiseptic cotton. There needs be no
  grease or oil upon the cotton. After the separation of the cord the navel
  should be dressed with a little cosmoline, still using the absorbent
  cotton. The navel string usually separates in a week's time; it may be
  delayed for twice this length of time, this will make no material
  difference, and the rule is to allow it to drop off of its own
  accord.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Clothing of the Infant.</b>&mdash;The clothing of the infant
  should be light, soft and <i>perfectly</i> loose. A soft flannel band is
  necessary <i>only</i> until the navel is healed. Afterwards discard bands
  entirely if you wish your babe to be happy and well. Make the dresses
  "Mother Hubbard"&mdash;Put on first a soft woolen shirt, then prepare the
  flannel skirts to hang from the neck like a slip. Make one kind with
  sleeves and one just like it without sleeves, then white muslin skirts
  (if they are desired), all the same way. Then baby is ready for any
  weather. In intense heat simply put on the one flannel slip with sleeves,
  leaving off the shirt. In Spring and Fall the shirt and skirt with no
  sleeves. In cold weather shirt and both skirts. These garments can be all
  put on at once, thus making the process of dressing very quick and easy.
  These are the most approved modern styles for dressing infants, and with
  long cashmere stockings pinned to the diapers the little feet are free to
  kick with no old-fashioned pinning blanket to torture the naturally
  active, healthy child, and retard its development. If tight bands are an
  injury to grown people, then in the name of pity emancipate the poor
  little infant from their torture!</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Diaper.</b>&mdash;Diapers should be of soft linen, and great
  care should be exercised not to pin them too tightly. Never dry them, but
  always wash them thoroughly before being used again.</p>

  <p>8. The band need not be worn after the navel has healed so that it
  requires no dressing, as it serves no purpose save to keep in place the
  dressing of the navel. The child's body should be kept thoroughly warm
  around the chest, bowels and feet. Give the heart and lungs plenty of
  room to heave.</p>

  <p>9. The proper time for shortening the clothes is about three months in
  Summer and six months in Winter. <!-- Page 317 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page317"></a>[317]</span></p>

  <p>10. <b>Infant Bathing.</b>&mdash;The first week of a child's life it
  should not be entirely stripped and washed. It is too exhausting. After a
  child is over a week old it should be bathed every day; after a child is
  three weeks old it may be put in the water and supported with one hand
  while it is being washed with the other. Never, however, allow it to
  remain too long in the water. From ten to twenty minutes is the limit.
  Use Pears' soap or castile soap, and with a sponge wipe quickly, or use a
  soft towel.</p>

<h2>NURSING.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs318.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/318.jpg"
      alt="The Happy Family." title="The Happy Family." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>1. The new-born infant requires only the mother's milk. The true
  mother will nurse her child if it is a possibility. The infant will
  thrive better and have many more chances for life.</p>

  <p>2. The mother's milk is the natural food, and nothing can fully take
  its place. It needs no feeding for the first few days as it was commonly
  deemed necessary a few years ago. The secretions in the mother's breast
  are sufficient.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Artificial Food.</b>&mdash;Tokology says: "The best artificial
  food is cream reduced and sweetened with sugar of milk. Analysis shows
  that human milk contains more cream and sugar and less casein than the
  milk of animals. <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>[318]</span></p>

  <p>4. Milk should form the basis of all preparations of food. If the milk
  is too strong, indigestion will follow, and the child will lose instead
  of gaining strength.</p>

  <p><b>Weaning.</b>&mdash;The weaning of the child depends much upon the
  strength and condition of the mother. If it does not occur in hot
  weather, from nine to twelve months is as long as any child should be
  nursed.</p>

  <p><b>Food in Weaning.</b>&mdash;Infants cry a great deal during weaning,
  but a few days of patient perseverance will overcome all difficulties.
  Give the child purely a milk diet, Graham bread, milk crackers and milk,
  or a little milk thickened with boiled rice, a little jelly, apple sauce,
  etc., may be safely used. Cracked wheat, oatmeal, wheat germ, or anything
  of that kind thoroughly cooked and served with a little cream and sugar,
  is an excellent food.</p>

  <p><b>Milk Drawn from the Breasts.</b>&mdash;If the mother suffers
  considerably from the milk gathering in the breast after weaning the
  child, withdraw it by taking a bottle that holds about a pint or a quart,
  putting a piece of cloth wrung out in warm water around the bottle, then
  fill it with boiling water, pour the water out and apply the bottle to
  the breast, and the bottle cooling will form a vacuum and will withdraw
  the milk into the bottle. This is one of the best methods now in use.</p>

  <p><b>Return of the Menses.</b>&mdash;If the menses return while the
  mother is nursing, the child should at once be weaned, for the mother's
  milk no longer contains sufficient nourishment. In case the mother should
  become pregnant while the child is nursing it should at once be weaned,
  or serious results will follow to the health of the child. A mother's
  milk is no longer sufficiently rich to nourish the child or keep it in
  good health.</p>

  <p><b>Care of the Bottle.</b>&mdash;If the child is fed on the bottle,
  great care should be taken in keeping it absolutely clean. Never use
  white rubber nipples. A plain form of bottle with a black rubber nipple
  is preferable.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Children</span> should not be permitted to come to
  the table until two years of age.</p>

  <p><b>Chafing.</b>&mdash;One of the best remedies is powdered lycopodium;
  apply it every time the babe is cleaned; but first wash with pure castile
  soap; Pears' soap is also good. A preparation of oxide of zinc is also
  highly recommended. Chafing sometimes results from an acid condition of
  the stomach; in that case give a few doses of castoria.</p>

  <p><b>Colic.</b>&mdash;If an infant is seriously troubled with colic,
  there is nothing better than camomile or catnip tea. Procure the leaves
  and make tea and give it as warm as the babe can bear.</p>

<hr class="full" >

<p><!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<h2>FEEDING INFANTS.</h2>

  <p>1. The best food for infants is mother's milk; next best is cow's
  milk. Cow's milk contains about three times as much curd and one-half as
  much sugar, and it should be reduced with two parts of water.</p>

  <p>2. In feeding cow's milk there is too little cream and too little
  sugar, and there is no doubt no better preparation than Mellin's food to
  mix it with (according to directions).</p>

  <p>3. Children being fed on food lacking fat generally have their teeth
  come late; their muscles will be flabby and bones soft. Children will be
  too fat when their food contains too much sugar. Sugar always makes their
  flesh soft and flabby.</p>

  <p>4. During the first two months the baby should be fed every two hours
  during the day, and two or three times during the night, but no more. Ten
  or eleven feedings for twenty-four hours are all a child will bear and
  remain healthy. At three months the child may be fed every three hours
  instead of every two.</p>

  <p>5. Children can be taught regular habits by being fed and put to sleep
  at the same time every day and evening. Nervous diseases are caused by
  irregular hours of sleep and diet, and the use of soothing medicines.</p>

  <p>6. A child five or six months old should not be fed during the
  night&mdash;from nine in the evening until six or seven in the morning,
  as overfeeding causes most of the wakefulness and nervousness of children
  during the night.</p>

  <p>7. If a child vomits soon after taking the bottle, and there is an
  appearance of undigested food in the stool, it is a sign of overfeeding.
  If a large part of the bottle has been vomited, avoid the next bottle at
  regular time and pass over one bottle. If the child is nursing the same
  principles apply.</p>

  <p>8. If a child empties its bottle and sucks vigorously its fingers
  after the bottle is emptied, it is very evident that the child is not fed
  enough, and should have its food gradually increased.</p>

  <p>9. Give the baby a little cold water several times a day.</p>

<hr class="full" >

<h2>INFANTILE CONVULSIONS.</h2>

  <p><b>Definition.</b>&mdash;An infantile convulsion corresponds to a
  chill in an adult, and is the most common brain affection among
  children.</p>

  <p><b>Causes.</b>&mdash;Anything that irritates the nervous system may
  cause convulsions in the child, as teething, indigestible food, worms,
  dropsy of the brain, hereditary constitution, or they may be the
  accompanying symptom in nearly all the <!-- Page 320 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page320"></a>[320]</span>acute diseases of
  children, or when the eruption is suppressed in eruptive diseases.</p>

  <p><b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;In case of convulsions of a child parents
  usually become frightened, and very rarely do the things that should be
  done in order to afford relief. The child, previous to the fit, is
  usually irritable, and the twitching of the muscles of the face may be
  noticed, or it may come on suddenly without warning. The child becomes
  insensible, clenches its hands tightly, lips turn blue, and the eyes
  become fixed, usually frothing from the mouth with head turned back. The
  convulsion generally lasts two or three minutes; sometimes, however, as
  long as ten or fifteen minutes, but rarely.</p>

  <p><b>Remedy.</b>&mdash;Give the child a warm bath and rub gently.
  Clothes wrung out of cold water and applied to the lower and back part of
  the head and plenty of fresh air will usually relieve the convulsion. Be
  sure and loosen the clothing around the child's neck. After the
  convulsion is over, give the child a few doses of potassic bromide, and
  an injection of castor oil if the abdomen is swollen. Potassic bromide
  should be kept in the house, to use in case of necessity.</p>

<h2>Pains and Ills in Nursing.</h2>

    The City Hospital.&mdash;A Homeless and Friendless Mother.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Sore Nipples.</b>&mdash;If a lady, during the latter few months
  of her pregnancy, <span class="correction" title="text reads `where'"
  >were</span> to adopt "means to harden the nipples," sore nipples during
  the period of suckling would not be so prevalent as they are.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Cause.</b>&mdash;A sore nipple is frequently produced by the
  injudicious custom of allowing the child to have the nipple <!-- Page 322
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>[322]</span>almost
  constantly in his mouth. Another frequent cause of a sore nipple is from
  the babe having the canker. Another cause of a sore nipple is from the
  mother, after the babe has been sucking, putting up the nipple wet. She,
  therefore, ought always to dry the nipple, not by rubbing, but by dabbing
  it with a soft cambric or lawn handkerchief, or with a piece of soft
  linen rag&mdash;one or the other of which ought always to be at
  hand&mdash;every time directly after the child has done sucking, and just
  before applying any of the following powders or lotions to the
  nipple.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Remedies.</b>&mdash;One of the best remedies for a sore nipple
  is the following powder:</p>

  <p>Take of&mdash;Borax, one drachm; Powdered Starch, seven drachms.</p>

  <p>Mix.&mdash;A pinch of the powder to be frequently applied to the
  nipple.</p>

  <p>If the above does not cure, try Glycerine by applying it each time
  after nursing.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Gathered Breast.</b>&mdash;A healthy-woman with a well-developed
  breast and a good nipple, scarcely, if ever, has a gathered bosom; it is
  the delicate, the ill-developed breasted and worse-developed nippled lady
  who usually suffers from this painful complaint. And why? The evil can
  generally be traced to girlhood. If she be brought up luxuriously, her
  health and her breasts are sure to be weakened, and thus to suffer, more
  especially if the development of the bosoms and nipples has been arrested
  and interfered with by tight stays and corsets. Why, the nipple is by
  them drawn in, and retained on the level with the
  breast&mdash;countersunk&mdash;as though it were of no consequence to her
  future well-being, as though it were a thing of nought.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Tight Lacers.</b>&mdash;Tight lacers will have to pay the
  penalties of which they little dream. Oh, the monstrous folly of such
  proceedings! When will mothers awake from their lethargy? It is high time
  that they did so! From the mother having "no nipple," the effects of
  tight lacing, many a home has been made childless, the babe not being
  able to procure its proper nourishment, and dying in consequence! It is a
  frightful state of things! But fashion, unfortunately, blinds the eyes
  and deafens the ears of its votaries!</p>

  <p>6. <b>Bad Breast.</b>&mdash;A gathered bosom, or "bad breast," as it
  is sometimes called, is more likely to occur after a first confinement
  and during the first month. Great care, therefore, ought to be taken to
  avoid such a misfortune. A gathered breast is frequently owing to the
  carelessness of a <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page323"></a>[323]</span>mother in not covering her bosoms during
  the time she is suckling. Too much attention cannot be paid to keeping
  the breasts comfortably warm. This, during the act of nursing, should be
  done by throwing either a shawl or a square of flannel over the neck,
  shoulders, and bosoms.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Another Cause.</b>&mdash;Another cause of gathered breasts
  arises from a mother sitting up in bed to suckle her babe. He ought to be
  accustomed to take the bosom while she is lying down; if this habit is
  not at first instituted, it will be difficult to adopt it afterwards.
  Good habits may be taught a child from earliest babyhood.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Faintness.</b>&mdash;When a nursing mother feels faint, she
  ought immediately to lie down and take a little nourishment; a cup of tea
  with the yolk of an egg beaten up in it, or a cup of warm milk, or some
  beef-tea, any of which will answer the purpose extremely well. Brandy, or
  any other spirit we would not recommend, as it would only cause, as soon
  as the immediate effects of the stimulant had gone off, a greater
  depression to ensue; not only so, but the frequent taking of brandy might
  become a habit&mdash;a necessity&mdash;which would be a calamity deeply
  to be deplored!</p>

  <p>9. <b>Strong Purgatives.</b>&mdash;Strong purgatives during this
  period are highly improper, as they are apt to give pain to the infant,
  as well as to injure the mother. If it be absolutely necessary to give
  physic, the mildest, such as a dose of castor oil, should be chosen.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Habitually Costive.</b>&mdash;When a lady who is nursing is
  habitually costive, she ought to eat brown instead of white bread. This
  will, in the majority of cases, enable her to do without an aperient. The
  brown bread may be made with flour finely ground all one way; or by
  mixing one part of bran and three parts of fine wheaten flour together,
  and then making it in the usual way into bread. Treacle instead of
  butter, on the brown bread increases its efficacy as an aperient; and raw
  should be substituted for lump sugar in her tea.</p>

  <p>11. <b>To Prevent Constipation.</b>&mdash;Stewed prunes, or stewed
  French plums, or stewed Normandy pippins, are excellent remedies to
  prevent constipation. The patient ought to eat, every morning, a dozen or
  fifteen of them. The best way to stew either prunes or French plums, is
  the following:&mdash;Put a pound of either prunes or French plums, and
  two tablespoonfuls of raw sugar, into a brown jar; cover them with water;
  put them into a slow oven, and stew them for three or four hours. Both
  stewed rhubarb and stewed <!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page324"></a>[324]</span>pears often act as mild and gentle
  aperients. Muscatel raisins, eaten at dessert, will oftentimes without
  medicine relieve the bowels.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Cold Water.</b>&mdash;A tumblerful of cold water, taken early
  every morning, sometimes effectually relieves the bowels; indeed, few
  people know the value of cold water as an aperient&mdash;it is one of the
  best we possess, and, unlike drug aperients, can never by any possibility
  do any harm. An injection of warm water is one of the best ways to
  relieve the bowels.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Well-Cooked Vegetables.</b>&mdash;Although a nursing mother
  ought, more especially if she be costive, to take a variety of
  well-cooked vegetables, such as potatoes, asparagus, cauliflower, French
  beans, spinach, stewed celery and turnips; she should avoid eating
  greens, cabbages, and pickles, as they would be likely to affect the
  babe, and might cause him to suffer from gripings, from pain, and
  "looseness" of the bowels.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Supersede the Necessity of Taking Physic.</b>&mdash;Let me
  again&mdash;for it cannot be too urgently insisted upon&mdash;strongly
  advise a nursing mother to use every means in the way of diet, etc., to
  supersede the necessity of taking physic (opening medicine), as the
  repetition of aperients injures, and that severely, both herself and
  child. Moreover, the more opening medicine she swallows, the more she
  requires; so that if she once gets into the habit of regularly taking
  physic, the bowels will not act without them. What a miserable existence
  to be always swallowing physic!</p>

    HEALTHY YOUTH AND RIPE OLD AGE.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Mismanagement.</b>&mdash;Every doctor knows that a large share
  of the ills to which infancy is subject are directly traceable to
  mismanagement. Troubles of the digestive system are, for the most part
  due to errors, either in the selection of the food or in the preparation
  of it.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Respiratory Diseases.</b>&mdash;Respiratory diseases or the
  diseases of the throat and lungs have their origin, as a rule, in want of
  care and judgment in matters of clothing, bathing and exposure to cold
  and drafts. A child should always be dressed to suit the existing
  temperature of the weather. <!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page326"></a>[326]</span></p>

  <p>3. <b>Nervous Diseases.</b>&mdash;Nervous diseases are often
  aggravated if not caused by over-stimulation of the brain, by irregular
  hours of sleep, or by the use of "soothing" medicines, or eating
  indigestible food.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Skin Affections.</b>&mdash;Skin affections are generally due to
  want of proper care of the skin, to improper clothing or feeding, or to
  indiscriminate association with nurses and children, who are the carriers
  of contagious diseases.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Permanent Injury.</b>&mdash;Permanent injury is often caused by
  lifting the child by one hand, allowing it to fall, permitting it to play
  with sharp instruments, etc.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Rules and Principles.</b>&mdash;Every mother should understand
  the rules and principles of home nursing. Children are very tender plants
  and the want of proper knowledge is often very disastrous if not fatal.
  Study carefully and follow the principles and rules which are laid down
  in the different parts of this work on nursing and cooking for the
  sick.</p>

  <p>7. <b>What a Mother Should Know:</b></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>I. <span class="sc">Infant Feeding</span>.&mdash;The care of milk,
  milk sterilization, care of bottles, preparation of commonly employed
  infant foods, the general principles of infant feeding, with rules as to
  quality and frequency.</p>

  <p>II. <span class="sc">Bathing</span>.&mdash;The daily bath; the use of
  hot, cold and mustard baths.</p>

  <p>III. <span class="sc">Hygiene of the Skin</span>. Care of the mouth,
  eyes and ears. Ventilation, temperature, cleanliness, care of napkins,
  etc.</p>

  <p>IV. <span class="sc">Training of Children</span> in proper bodily
  habits. Simple means of treatment in sickness, etc.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>8. <b>The Cry of the Sick Child.</b>&mdash;The cry of the child is a
  language by which the character of its suffering to some extent may be
  ascertained. The manner in which the cry is uttered, or the pitch and
  tone is generally a symptom of a certain kind of disease.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Stomachache.</b>&mdash;The cry of the child in suffering with
  pain of the stomach is loud, excitable and spasmodic. The legs are drawn
  up and as the pain ceases, they are relaxed and the child sobs itself to
  sleep, and rests until awakened again by pain.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Lung Trouble.</b>&mdash;When a child is suffering with an
  affection of the lungs or throat, it never cries loudly or continuously.
  A distress in breathing causes a sort of subdued cry and low moaning. If
  there is a slight cough it is generally a sign that there is some
  complication with the lungs. <!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page327"></a>[327]</span></p>

  <p>11. <b>Disease of the Brain.</b>&mdash;In disease of the brain the cry
  is always sharp, short and piercing. Drowsiness generally follows each
  spasm of pain.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Fevers.</b>&mdash;Children rarely cry when suffering with fever
  unless they are disturbed. They should be handled very gently and spoken
  to in a very quiet and tender tone of voice.</p>

  <p>13. <b>The Chamber of the Sick Room.</b>&mdash;The room of the sick
  child should be kept scrupulously clean. No noise should disturb the
  quiet and rest of the child. If the weather is mild, plenty of fresh air
  should be admitted; the temperature should be kept at about 70 degrees. A
  thermometer should be kept in the room, and the air should be changed
  several times during the day. This may be done with safety to the child
  by covering it up with woolen blankets to protect it from draft, while
  the windows and doors are opened. Fresh air often does more to restore
  the sick child than the doctor's medicine. Take the best room in the
  house. If necessary take the parlor, always make the room pleasant for
  the sick.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Visitors.</b>&mdash;Carefully avoid the conversation of
  visitors or the loud and boisterous playing of children in the house. If
  there is much noise about the house that cannot be avoided, it is a good
  plan to put cotton in the ears of the patient.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Light in the Room.</b>&mdash;Light has a tendency to produce
  nervous irritability, consequently it is best to exclude as much daylight
  as possible and keep the room in a sort of twilight until the child
  begins to improve. Be careful to avoid any odor coming from a burning
  lamp in the night. When the child begins to recover, give it plenty of
  sunlight. After the child begins to get better let in all the sunlight
  the windows will admit. Take a south room for the sick bed.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Sickness in Summer.</b>&mdash;If the weather is very hot it is
  a good plan to dampen the floors with cold water, or set several dishes
  of water in the room, but be careful to keep the patient out of the
  draft, and avoid any sudden change of temperature.</p>

  <p>17. <b>Bathing.</b>&mdash;Bathe every sick child in warm water once a
  day unless prohibited by the doctor. If the child has a spasm or any
  attack of a serious nervous character in absence of the doctor, place him
  in a hot bath at once. Hot water is one of the finest agencies for the
  cure of nervous diseases. <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page328"></a>[328]</span></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs329.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/329.jpg"
      alt="Baby." title="Baby." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>18. <b>Scarlet Fever and Measles.</b>&mdash;Bathe the child in warm
  water to bring out the rash, and put in about a dessertspoonful of
  mustard into each bath.</p>

  <p>19. <b>Drinks.</b>&mdash;If a child is suffering with fevers, let it
  have all the water it wants. Toast-water will be found nourishing. When
  the stomach of the child is in an irritable condition, nourishments
  containing milk or any other fluid should be given very sparingly.
  Barley-water and rice-water are very soothing to an irritable
  stomach.</p>

  <p>20. <b>Food.</b>&mdash;Mellin's Food and milk is very nourishing if
  the child will take it. Oatmeal gruel, white of eggs, etc. are excellent
  and nourishing articles. See "How to cook for the Sick."</p>

  <p>21. <b>Eating Fruit.</b>&mdash;Let children who are recovering from
  sickness eat moderately of good fresh fruit. Never let a child, whether
  well or sick, eat the skins of any kind of fruit. The outer covering of
  fruit was not made to eat, and often has poisonous matter very injurious
  to health upon its surface. Contagious and infectious diseases are often
  communicated in that way.</p>

  <p>22. <b>Sudden Startings</b> with the thumbs drawn into the palms,
  portend trouble with the brain, and often end in convulsions, which are
  far more serious in infants than in children. Convulsions in children
  often result from a suppression of urine. If you have occasion to believe
  that such is the case, get the patient to sweating as soon as possible.
  Give it a hot bath, after which cover it up in bed and put bags of hot
  salt over the lower part of the abdomen.</p>

  <p>23. <b>Symptoms of Indigestion.</b>&mdash;If the baby shows symptoms
  of indigestion, do not begin giving it medicine. It is wiser to decrease
  the quantity and quality of the food and let the little one omit one meal
  entirely, that his stomach may rest. Avoid all starchy foods, as the
  organs of digestion are not sufficiently developed to receive them.</p>

<h2>A Practical Rule for Feeding a Baby on Cow's Milk.</h2>

  <p>Cow's milk is steadily growing in favor as an artificial food. Country
  milk should be used instead of milk purchased in town or city.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Rule</span>&mdash;Take the upper half of milk that
  has stood an hour of two, dilute, not hardly as much as a third, with
  sweetened water, and if there is a tendency to sour stomach, put in a
  teaspoonful of lime water to every quart. The milk and water should both
  be boiled separately. If the baby is constipated, it is best to heat the
  milk over boiling water and not allow it to boil.</p>

<h2>HOW TO KEEP A BABY WELL.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs331.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/331.jpg"
      alt="Baby in BAth." title="Baby in BAth." /></a>
    A delicate child should never be put into the bath, but bathed on the
    lap and kept warmly covered.
  </div>
  <p>1. The mother's milk is the natural food, and nothing can fully take
  its place.</p>

  <p>2. The infant's stomach does not readily accommodate itself to changes
  in diet; therefore, regularity in quality, quantity and temperature is
  extremely necessary.</p>

  <p>3. Not until a child is a year old should it be allowed any food
  except that of milk, and possibly a little cracker or bread, thoroughly
  soaked and softened.</p>

  <p>4. Meat should never be given to very young children. The best
  artificial food is cream, reduced and sweetened with sugar and milk. No
  rule can be given for its reduction. Observation and experience must
  teach that, because every child's stomach is governed by a rule of its
  own.</p>

  <p>5. A child can be safely weaned at one year of age, and sometimes
  less. It depends entirely upon the season, and upon the health of the
  child.</p>

  <p>6. A child should never be weaned during the warm weather, in June,
  July or August.</p>

  <p>7. When a child is weaned it may be given, in connection <!-- Page 331
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>[331]</span>with the milk
  diet, some such nourishment as broth, gruel, egg, or some prepared
  food.</p>

  <p>8. A child should never be allowed to come to the table until two
  years of age.</p>

  <p>9. A child should never eat much starchy food until four years
  old.</p>

  <p>10. A child should have all the water it desires to drink, but it is
  decidedly the best to boil the water first, and allow it to cool. All the
  impurities and disease germs are thereby destroyed. This one thing alone
  will add greatly to the health and vigor of the child.</p>

  <p>11. Where there is a tendency to bowel disorder, a little gum arabic,
  rice, or barley may be boiled with the drinking water.</p>

  <p>12. If the child uses a bottle it should be kept absolutely clean. It
  is best to have two or three bottles, so that one will always be
  perfectly clean and fresh.</p>

  <p>13. The nipple should be of black or pure rubber, and not of the white
  or vulcanized rubber; it should fit over the top of the bottle. No tubes
  should ever be used; it is impossible to keep them clean.</p>

  <p>14. When the rubber becomes coated, a little coarse salt will clean
  it.</p>

  <p>15. Babies should be fed at regular times. They should also be put to
  sleep at regular hours. Regularity is one of the best safeguards to
  health.</p>

  <p>16. Milk for babies and children should be from healthy cows. Milk
  from different cows varies, and it is always better for a child to have
  milk from the same cow. A farrow cow's milk is preferable, especially if
  the child is not very strong.</p>

  <p>17. Many of the prepared foods advertised for children are of little
  benefit. A few may be good, but what is good for one child may not be for
  another. So it must be simply a matter of experiment if any of the
  advertised foods are used.</p>

  <p>18. It is a physiological fact that an infant is always healthier and
  better to sleep alone. It gets better air and is not liable to
  suffocation.</p>

  <p>19. A healthy child should never be fed in less than two hours from
  the last time they finished before, gradually lengthening the time as it
  grows older. At 4 months 3½ or 4 hours; at 5 months a healthy child will
  be better if given nothing in the night except, perhaps, a little
  water.</p>

  <p>20. Give an infant a little water several times a day.</p>

  <p>21. A delicate child the first year should be oiled after each bath.
  The oiling may often take the place of the bath, in case of a cold.</p>

  <p>22. In oiling a babe, use pure olive oil, and wipe off thoroughly
  after each application. For nourishing a weak child use also olive
  oil.</p>

  <p>23. For colds, coughs, croup, etc., use goose oil externally and give
  a teaspoonful at bed-time.</p>

<h2>HOW TO PRESERVE THE HEALTH AND LIFE OF YOUR
INFANT DURING HOT WEATHER.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs333.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/333.jpg"
      alt="Found upon the DOOR STEP." title="Found upon the DOOR STEP." /></a>
    FOUND UPON THE DOOR STEP.
  </div>
<p class="cenhead"><i>BATHING.</i></p>

  <p>1. Bathe infants daily in tepid water and even twice a day in hot
  weather.</p>

  <p>If delicate they should be sponged instead of immersing them in water,
  but cleanliness is absolutely necessary for the health of infants.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>CLOTHING.</i></p>

  <p>2. Put no bands in their clothing, but make all garments to hang
  loosely from the shoulders, and have all their clothing <i>scrupulously
  clean</i>; even the diaper should not be re-used without rinsing. <!--
  Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page333"></a>[333]</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>SLEEP ALONE.</i></p>

  <p>3. The child should in all cases sleep by itself on a cot or in a crib
  and retire at a regular hour. A child <i>always</i> early taught to go to
  sleep without rocking or nursing is the healthier and happier for it.
  Begin <i>at birth</i> and this will be easily accomplished.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>CORDIALS AND SOOTHING SYRUPS.</i></p>

  <p>4. Never give cordials, soothing syrups, sleeping drops, etc., without
  the advice of a physician. A child that frets and does not sleep is
  either hungry or ill. <i>If ill it needs a physician.</i> Never give
  candy or cake to quiet a small child, they are sure to produce disorders
  of the stomach, diarrh&oelig;a or some other trouble.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>FRESH AIR.</i></p>

  <p>5. Children should have plenty of fresh air summer as well as winter.
  Avoid the severe hot sun and the heated kitchen for infants in summer.
  Heat is the great destroyer of infants. In excessive hot weather feed
  them with chips of ice occasionally, if you have it.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>CLEAN HOUSES.</i></p>

  <p>6. Keep your house clean and cool and well aired night and day. Your
  cellars cleared of all rubbish and whitewashed every spring, your drains
  cleaned with strong solution of copperas or chloride of lime, poured down
  them once a week. Keep your gutters and yards clean and insist upon your
  neighbors doing the same.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>EVACUATIONS OF A CHILD.</i></p>

  <p>The healthy motion varies from light orange yellow to greenish yellow,
  in number, two to four times daily. Smell should never be offensive.
  Slimy mucous-like jelly passages indicate worms. Pale green, offensive,
  acrid motions indicate disordered stomach. Dark green indicate acid
  secretions and a more serious trouble.</p>

  <p>Fetid dark brown stools are present in chronic diarrh&oelig;a.
  Putty-like pasty passages are due to acidity curdling the milk or to
  torpid liver. <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page334"></a>[334]</span></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs335.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/335.jpg"
      alt="The Best." title="The Best." /></a>
  </div>
<p class="cenhead"><i>BREAST MILK.</i></p>

  <p>7. Breast milk is the only proper food for infants, until after the
  second summer. If the supply is small keep what you have and feed the
  child in connection with it, for if the babe is ill this breast milk may
  be all that will save its life.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>STERILIZED MILK.</i></p>

  <p>8. Milk is the best food. Goat's milk best, cows milk next. If the
  child thrives on this <i>nothing else</i> should be given during the hot
  weather, until the front teeth are cut. Get fresh cow's milk twice a day
  if the child requires food in the night, pour it into a glass fruit jar
  with one-third pure water for a child under three months old, afterwards
  the proportion of water may be less and less, also a trifle of sugar may
  be added.</p>

  <p>Then place the jar in a kettle or pan of cold water, like the bottom
  of an oatmeal kettle. Leave the cover of the jar loose. Place it on the
  stove and let the water come to a boil and boil ten minutes, screw down
  the cover tight and boil ten minutes more, then remove from the fire, and
  allow it to cool in the water slowly so as not to break the jar. When
  partly cool put on the ice or in a cool place, and keep tightly covered
  except when the milk is poured out for use. The glass jar must be kept
  perfectly clean and washed <!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page335"></a>[335]</span>and scalded carefully before use. A
  tablespoonful of lime water to a bottle of milk will aid indigestion.
  Discard the bottle as soon as possible and use a cup which you know is
  clean, whereas a bottle must be kept in water constantly when not in use,
  or the sour milk will make the child sick. Use no tube for it is
  exceedingly hard to keep it clean, and if pure milk cannot be had,
  condensed milk is admirable and does not need to be sterilized as the
  above.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>DIET.</i></p>

  <p>9. Never give babies under two years old such food as grown persons
  eat. Their chief diet should be milk, wheat bread and milk, oatmeal,
  possibly a little rare boiled egg, but always and chiefly milk. Germ
  wheat is also excellent.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>EXERCISE.</i></p>

  <p>10. Children should have exercise in the house as well as outdoors,
  but should not be jolted and jumped and jarred in rough play, not rudely
  rocked in the cradle, nor carelessly trundled over bumps in their
  carriages. They should not be held too much in the arms, but allowed to
  crawl and kick upon the floor and develop their limbs and muscles. A
  child should not be lifted by its arms, nor dragged along by one hand
  after it learns to take a few feeble steps, but when they do learn to
  walk steadily it is the best of all exercise, especially in the open
  air.</p>

  <p>Let the children as they grow older romp and play in the open air all
  they wish, girls as well as boys. Give the girls an even chance for
  health, while they are young at least, and don't mind about their
  complexion.</p>

<h2>Infant Teething.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs337.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/337.jpg"
      alt="Teeth." title="Teeth." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Remarkable Instances.</b>&mdash;There are instances where babies
  have been born with teeth, and, on the other hand, there are cases of
  persons who have never had any teeth at all; and others that had double
  teeth all around in both upper and lower jaws, but these are rare
  instances, and may be termed as a sort of freaks of nature.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Infant Teething.</b>&mdash;The first teeth generally make their
  appearance after the third month, and during the period of teething the
  child is fretful and restless, causing sometimes constitutional
  disturbances, such as diarrh&oelig;a, indigestion, etc. Usually, however,
  no serious results follow, and no unnecessary anxiety need be felt,
  unless the weather is extremely warm, then there is some danger of summer
  complaint setting in and seriously complicating matters.</p>

  <p>3. <b>The Number of Teeth.</b>&mdash;Teeth are generally cut in pairs
  and make their appearance first in the front and going backwards until
  all are complete. It generally takes about <!-- Page 337 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>[337]</span>two years for a
  temporary set of children's teeth. A child two or three years old should
  have twenty teeth. After the age of seven they generally begin to loosen
  and fall out and permanent teeth take their place.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Lancing the Gums.</b>&mdash;This is very rarely necessary. There
  are extreme cases when the condition of the mouth and health of the child
  demand a physician's lance but this should not be resorted to, unless it
  is absolutely necessary. When the gums are very much swollen and the
  tooth is nearly through, the pains may be relieved by the mother taking a
  thimble and pressing it down upon the tooth, the sharp edges of the tooth
  will cut through the swollen flesh, and instant relief will follow. A
  child in a few hours or a day will be perfectly happy after a very severe
  and trying time of sickness.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Permanent Teeth.</b>&mdash;The teeth are firmly inserted in
  sockets of the upper and lower jaw. The permanent teeth which follow the
  temporary teeth, when complete, are sixteen in each jaw, or thirty-two in
  all.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Names of Teeth.</b>&mdash;There are four incisors (front teeth),
  four cuspids (eye teeth), four bicuspids (grinders), and four molars
  (large grinders), in each jaw. Each tooth is divided into the crown,
  body, and root. The crown is the grinding surface; the body&mdash;the
  part projecting from the jaw&mdash;is the seat of sensation and
  nutrition; the root is that portion of the tooth which is inserted in the
  alveolus. The teeth are composed of dentine (ivory) and enamel. The ivory
  forms the greater portion of the body and root, while the enamel covers
  the exposed surface. The small white cords communicating with the teeth
  are the nerves.</p>

<h2>HOME TREATMENT FOR THE DISEASES OF INFANTS
AND CHILDREN.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

      alt="Child." title="Child." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>1. Out of the 984,000 persons that died during the year of 1890,
  227,264 did not reach one year of age, and 400,647 died under five years
  of age.</p>

  <p>What a fearful responsibility therefore rests upon the parents who
  permit these hundreds of thousands of children to die annually. This
  terrible mortality among children is undoubtedly largely the result of
  ignorance as regarding to the proper care and treatment of sick
  children.</p>

  <p>2. For very small children it is always best to use hom&oelig;opathic
  remedies.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>COLIC.</i></p>

  <p>1. Babies often suffer severely with colic. It is not considered
  dangerous, but causes considerable suffering.</p>

  <p>2. Severe colic is usually the result of derangement of the liver in
  the mother, or of her insufficient or improper nourishment, and it occurs
  more frequently when the child is from two to five months old. <!-- Page
  339 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>[339]</span></p>

  <p>3. Let the mother eat chiefly barley, wheat and bread, rolled wheat,
  graham bread, fish, milk, eggs and fruit. The latter may be freely eaten,
  avoiding that which is very sour.</p>

  <p>4. A rubber bag or bottle filled with hot water put into a crib, will
  keep the child, once quieted, asleep for hours. If a child is suffering
  from colic, it should be thoroughly warmed and kept warm.</p>

  <p>5. Avoid giving opiates of any kind, such as cordials, Mrs. Winslow's
  Soothing Syrup, "Mother's Friend," and various other patent medicines.
  They injure the stomach and health of the child, instead of benefiting
  it.</p>

  <p>6. <span class="sc">Remedies</span>.&mdash;A few tablespoonfuls of hot
  water will often allay a severe attack of the colic. Catnip tea is also a
  good remedy.</p>

  <p>A drop of essence of peppermint in 6 or 7 teaspoonfuls of hot water
  will give relief.</p>

  <p>If the stools are green and the child is very restless, give
  chamomilla.</p>

  <p>If the child is suffering from constipation, and undigested curds of
  milk appear in its fæces, and the child starts suddenly in its sleep,
  give nux vomica.</p>

  <p>An injection of a few spoonfuls of hot water into the rectum with a
  little asaf&oelig;tida is an effective remedy, and will be good for an
  adult.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>CONSTIPATION.</i></p>

  <p>1. This is a very frequent ailment of infants. The first thing
  necessary is for the mother to regulate her diet.</p>

  <p>2. If the child is nursed regularly and held out at the same time of
  each day, it will seldom be troubled with this complaint. Give plenty of
  <i>water</i>. Regularity of habit is the remedy. If this method fails,
  use a soap suppository. Make it by paring a piece of white castile soap
  round. It should be made about the size of a lead pencil, pointed at the
  end.</p>

  <p>3. Avoid giving a baby drugs. Let the physician administer them if
  necessary. <!-- Page 340 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page340"></a>[340]</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>DIARRH&OElig;A.</i></p>

  <p>Great care should be exercised by parents in checking the
  diarrh&oelig;a of children. Many times serious diseases are brought on by
  parents being too hasty in checking this disorder of the bowels. It is an
  infant's first method of removing obstructions and overcoming
  derangements of the system.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>SUMMER COMPLAINT.</i></p>

  <p>1. Summer complaint is an irritation and inflammation of the lining
  membranes of the intestines. This may often be caused by teething, eating
  indigestible food, etc.</p>

  <p>2. If the discharges are only frequent and yellow and not accompanied
  with pain, there is no cause for anxiety; but if the discharges are
  green, soon becoming gray, brown and sometimes frothy, having a mixture
  of phlegm, and sometimes containing food undigested, a physician had
  better be summoned.</p>

  <p>3. For mild attacks the following treatment may be given:</p>

  <p>1) Keep the child perfectly quiet and keep the room well aired.</p>

  <p>2) Put a drop of tincture of camphor on a teaspoonful of sugar, mix
  thoroughly; then add 6 teaspoonfuls of hot water and give a teaspoonful
  of the mixture every ten minutes. This is indicated where the discharges
  are watery, and where there is vomiting and coldness of the feet and
  hands. Chamomilla is also an excellent remedy. Ipecac and nux vomica may
  also be given.</p>

  <p>In giving hom&oelig;opathic remedies, give 5 or 6 pellets every 2 or 3
  hours.</p>

  <p>3) The diet should be wholesome and nourishing.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>FOR TEETHING.</i></p>

  <p>If a child is suffering with swollen gums, is feverish, restless, and
  starts in its sleep, give nux vomica. <!-- Page 341 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page341"></a>[341]</span></p>

<h3>WORMS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><i>PIN WORMS.</i></p>

  <p>Pin worms and round worms are the most common in children. They are
  generally found in the lower bowels.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;Restlessness, itching about
  the anus in the fore part of the evening, and worms in the fæces.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Treatment</span>.&mdash;Give with a syringe an
  injection of a tablespoonful of linseed oil. Cleanliness is also very
  necessary.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>ROUND WORMS.</i></p>

  <p>A round worm is from six to sixteen inches in length, resembling the
  common earth worm. It inhabits generally the small intestines, but it
  sometimes enters the stomach and is thrown up by vomiting.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;Distress, indigestion,
  swelling of the abdomen, grinding of the teeth, restlessness, and
  sometimes convulsions.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Treatment</span>.&mdash;One teaspoonful of powdered
  wormseed mixed with a sufficient quantity of molasses, or spread on bread
  and butter.</p>

  <p>Or, one grain of santonine every four hours for two or three days,
  followed by a brisk cathartic. Wormwood tea is also highly
  recommended.</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span class="sc">Swaim's Vermifuge</span>.</p>
      <p>2 ounces wormseed,</p>

<h2>HOW TO TREAT CROUP</h2>

<h3>SPASMODIC AND TRUE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><i>SPASMODIC CROUP.</i></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs343.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/343.jpg"
      alt="Child." title="Child." /></a>
  </div>
  <p><span class="sc">Definition</span>.&mdash;A spasmodic closure of the
  glottis which interferes with respiration. Comes on suddenly and usually
  at night, without much warning. It is a purely nervous disease and may be
  caused by reflex nervous irritation from undigested food in the stomach
  or bowels, irritation of the gums in dentition, or from brain
  disorders.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;Child awakens suddenly at
  night with suspended respiration or very difficult breathing. After a few
  respirations it cries out and then falls asleep quietly, or the attack
  may last an hour or so, when the face will become pale, veins in the neck
  become turgid and feet and hands contract spasmodically. In mild cases
  the attacks will only occur once during the night, but may recur on the
  following night.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;During the paroxysm
  dashing cold water in the face is a common remedy. To terminate the spasm
  and prevent its return give teaspoonful doses of <!-- Page 343 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page343"></a>[343]</span>powdered alum. The
  syrup of squills is an old and tried remedy; give in 15 to 30 drop doses
  and repeat every 10 minutes till vomiting occurs. Seek out the cause if
  possible and remove it. It commonly lies in some derangement of the
  digestive organs.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>TRUE CROUP.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Definition</span>.&mdash;This disease consists of an
  inflammation of the mucous membrane of the upper air passages,
  particularly of the larynx with the formation of a false membrane that
  obstructs the breathing. The disease is most common in children between
  the ages of two and seven years, but it may occur at any age.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;Usually there are symptoms of
  a cold for three or four days previous to the attack. Marked hoarseness
  is observed in the evening with a ringing metallic cough and some
  difficulty in breathing, which increases and becomes somewhat paroxysmal
  till the face which was at first flushed becomes pallid and ashy in hue.
  The efforts at breathing become very great, and unless the child gets
  speedy relief it will die of suffocation.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;Patient should be kept
  in a moist warm atmosphere, and cold water applied to the neck early in
  the attack. As soon as the breathing seems difficult give a half to one
  teaspoonful of powdered alum in honey to produce vomiting and apply the
  remedies suggested in the treatment of diphtheria, as the two diseases
  are thought by many to be identical. When the breathing becomes labored
  and face becomes pallid, the condition is very serious and a physician
  should be called without delay.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>SCARLET FEVER.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Definition</span>.&mdash;An eruptive contagious
  disease, brought about by direct exposure to those having the disease, or
  by contact with clothing, dishes, or other articles, used about the sick
  room.</p>

  <p>The clothing may be disinfected by heating to a temperature of 230°
  Fahrenheit or by dipping in boiling water before washing. <!-- Page 344
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344"></a>[344]</span></p>

  <p>Dogs and cats will also carry the disease and should be kept from the
  house, and particularly from the sick room.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;Chilly sensations or a decided
  chill, fever, headache, furred tongue, vomiting, sore throat, rapid
  pulse, hot dry skin and more or less stupor. In from 6 to 18 hours a fine
  red rash appears about the ears, neck and shoulders, which rapidly
  spreads to the entire surface of the body. After a few days, a scurf or
  branny scales will begin to form on the skin. These scales are the
  principal source of contagion.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.</p>

  <p>1. Isolate the patient from other members of the family to prevent the
  spread of the disease.</p>

  <p>2. Keep the patient in bed and give a fluid diet of milk gruel, beef
  tea, etc., with plenty of cold water to drink.</p>

  <p>3. Control the fever by sponging the body with tepid water, and
  relieve the pain in the throat by cold compresses, applied
  externally.</p>

  <p>4. As soon as the skin shows a tendency to become scaly, apply goose
  grease or clean lard with a little boracic acid powder dusted in it, or
  better, perhaps, carbolized vaseline to relieve the itching and prevent
  the scales from being scattered about, and subjecting others to the
  contagion.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Regular Treatment</span>.&mdash;A few drops of
  aconite every three hours to regulate the pulse, and if the skin be pale
  and circulation feeble, with tardy eruption, administer one to ten drops
  of tincture of belladonna, according to the age of the patient. At the
  end of third week, if eyes look puffy and feet swell, there is danger of
  Acute Bright's disease, and a physician should be consulted. If the case
  does not progress well under the home remedies suggested, a physician
  should be called at once.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>WHOOPING COUGH.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Definition</span>.&mdash;This is a contagious disease
  which is known by a peculiar whooping sound in the cough. Considerable
  mucus is thrown off after each attack of spasmodic coughing.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;It usually commences with the
  symptoms of a common cold in the head, some chilliness, feverishness,
  <!-- Page 345 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page345"></a>[345]</span>restlessness, headache, a feeling of
  tightness across the chest, violent paroxysms of coughing, sometimes
  almost threatening suffocation, and accompanied with vomiting.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;Patient should eat plain
  food and avoid cold drafts and damp air, but keep in the open air as much
  as possible. A strong tea made of the tops of red clover is highly
  recommended. A strong tea made of chestnut leaves, sweetened with sugar,
  is also very good.</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1 teaspoonful of powdered alum.</p>
      <p>1 teaspoonful of syrup.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Mix in a tumbler of water, and give the child one teaspoonful every
  two or three hours. A kerosene lamp kept burning in the bed chamber at
  night is said to lessen the cough and shorten the course of the
  disease.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>MUMPS.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Definition</span>.&mdash;This is a contagious disease
  causing the inflammation of the salivary glands, and is generally a
  disease of childhood and youth.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;A slight fever, stiffness of
  the neck and lower jaw, swelling and soreness of the gland. It usually
  develops in four or five days and then begins to disappear.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;Apply to the swelling a
  hot poultice of cornmeal and bread and milk. A hop poultice is also
  excellent. Take a good dose of physic and rest carefully. A warm general
  bath, or mustard foot bath, is very good. Avoid exposure or cold drafts.
  If a bad cold is taken, serious results may follow.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>MEASLES.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Definition</span>.&mdash;It is an eruptive,
  contagious disease, preceded by cough and other catarrhal symptoms for
  about four or five days. The eruption comes rapidly in small red spots,
  which are slightly raised.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;A feeling of weakness, loss of
  appetite, some fever, cold in the head, frequent sneezing, watery eyes,
  dry cough and a hot skin. The disease takes effect nine or ten days after
  exposure. <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page346"></a>[346]</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;Measles is not a
  dangerous disease in the child, but in an adult it is often very serious.
  In childhood very little medicine is necessary, but exposure must be
  carefully avoided, and the patient kept in bed, in a moderately warm
  room. The diet should be light and nourishing. Keep the room dark. If the
  eruption does not come out promptly, apply hot baths.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Common Treatment</span>.&mdash;Two teaspoonfuls of
  spirits of nitre, one teaspoonful paregoric, one wineglassful of camphor
  water. Mix thoroughly, and give a teaspoonful in half a tea-cupful of
  water every two hours. To relieve the cough, if troublesome, flax seed
  tea, or infusion of slippery-elm bark, with a little lemon juice to
  render more palatable, will be of benefit.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>CHICKEN POX.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Definition</span>.&mdash;This is a contagious,
  eruptive disease, which resembles to some extent small-pox. The pointed
  vesicles or pimples have a depression in the center in chicken-pox, and
  in small pox they do not.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;Nine to seventeen days elapse
  after the exposure, before symptoms appear. Slight fever, a sense of
  sickness, the appearance of scattered pimples, some itching and heat. The
  pimples rapidly change into little blisters, filled with a watery fluid.
  After five or six days they disappear.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;Milk diet, and avoid all
  kinds of meat. Keep the bowels open, and avoid all exposure to cold.
  Large vesicles on the face should be punctured early, and irritation by
  rubbing should be avoided.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>HOME TREATMENT OF DIPHTHERIA.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Definition</span>.&mdash;Acute, specific,
  constitutional disease, with local manifestations in the throat, mouth,
  nose, larynx, windpipe, and glands of the neck. The disease is
  infectious, but not very contagious under the proper precautions. It is a
  disease of childhood, though adults sometimes contract it. Many of the
  best physicians of the day consider true or membranous croup to be due to
  this diphtheritic membranous disease thus located in the larynx or
  trachea. <!-- Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page347"></a>[347]</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;Symptoms vary according to the
  severity of the attack. Chills, fever, headache, languor, loss of
  appetite, stiffness of neck, with tenderness about the angles of the jaw,
  soreness of the throat, pain in the ear, aching of the limbs, loss of
  strength, coated tongue, swelling of the neck, and offensive breath;
  lymphatic glands on side of neck enlarged and tender. The throat is first
  to be seen red and swollen, then covered with grayish white patches,
  which spread, and a false membrane is found on the mucous membrane. If
  the nose is attacked, there will be an offensive discharge, and the child
  will breathe through the mouth. If the larynx or throat are involved, the
  voice will become hoarse, and a croupy cough, with difficult breathing,
  shows that the air passage to the lungs is being obstructed by the false
  membrane.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;Isolate the patient, to
  prevent the spread of the disease. Diet should be of the most nutritious
  character, as milk, eggs, broths, and oysters. Give at intervals of every
  two or three hours. If patient refuses to swallow, from the pain caused
  by the effort, a nutrition injection must be resorted to. Inhalations of
  steam and hot water, and allowing the patient to suck pellets of ice,
  will give relief. Sponges dipped in hot water, and applied to the angles
  of the jaw, are beneficial. Inhalations of lime, made by slaking freshly
  burnt lime in a vessel, and directing the vapor to the child's mouth, by
  means of a newspaper, or similar contrivance. Flour of sulphur, blown
  into the back of the mouth and throat by means of a goose quill, has been
  highly recommended. Frequent gargling of the throat and mouth, with a
  solution of lactic acid, strong enough to taste sour, will help to keep
  the parts clean, and correct the foul breath. If there is great
  prostration, with the nasal passage affected, or hoarseness and difficult
  breathing, a physician should be called at once.</p>

<h2>DISEASES OF WOMEN.</h2>

<h3><i>DISORDERS OF THE MENSES.</i></h3>

<p class="cenhead">1. <span class="sc">Suppression of, or Scanty Menses</span>.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs349.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/349.jpg"
      alt="Woman." title="Woman." /></a>
  </div>
  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;Attention to the diet,
  and exercise in the open air to promote the general health. Some bitter
  tonic, taken with fifteen grains of dialyzed iron, well diluted, after
  meals, if patient is pale and debilitated. A hot foot bath is often all
  that is necessary.</p>

<p class="cenhead">2. <span class="sc">Profuse Menstruation</span>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;Avoid highly seasoned
  food, and the use of spirituous liquors; also excessive fatigue, either
  physical or mental. To check the flow, patient should be kept quiet, and
  allowed to sip cinnamon tea during the period.</p>

<p class="cenhead">3. <span class="sc">Painful Menstruation</span>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;Often brought on by
  colds. Treat by warm hip baths, hot drinks (avoiding spirituous liquors),
  and heat applied to the back and extremities. A teaspoonful of the fluid
  extract of viburnum will sometimes act like a charm.</p>

<h3><i>HOW TO CURE SWELLED AND SORE
BREASTS.</i></h3>

  <p>Take and boil a quantity of chamomile, and apply the hot fomentations.
  This dissolves the knot, and reduce the swelling and soreness. <!-- Page
  349 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page349"></a>[349]</span></p>

<h3><i>LEUCORRHEA OR WHITES.</i></h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;This disorder, if not
  arising from some abnormal condition of the pelvic organs, can easily be
  cured by patient taking the proper amount of exercise and good nutritious
  food, avoiding tea and coffee. An injection every evening of one
  teaspoonful of Pond's Extract in a cup of hot water, after first
  cleansing the vagina well with a quart of warm water, is a simple but
  effective remedy.</p>

<h3><i>INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB.</i></h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;When in the acute form
  this disease is ushered in by a chill, followed by fever, and pain in the
  region of the womb. Patient should be placed in bed, and a brisk
  purgative given, hot poultices applied to the abdomen, and the feet and
  hands kept warm. If the symptoms do not subside, a physician should be
  consulted.</p>

<h3><i>HYSTERIA.</i></h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Definition</span>.&mdash;A functional disorder of the
  nervous system of which it is impossible to speak definitely;
  characterized by disturbance of the reason, will, imagination, and
  emotions, with sometimes convulsive attacks that resemble epilepsy.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Symptoms</span>.&mdash;Fits of laughter, and tears
  without apparent cause; emotions easily excited; mind often melancholy
  and depressed; tenderness along the spine; disturbances of digestion,
  with hysterical convulsions, and other nervous phenomena.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Home Treatment</span>.&mdash;Some healthy and
  pleasant employment should be urged upon women afflicted with this
  disease. Men are also subject to it, though not so frequently. Avoid
  excessive fatigue and mental worry; also stimulants and opiates. Plenty
  of good food and fresh air will do more good than drugs.</p>

<hr class="full" >

<p><!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page350"></a>[350]</span></p>

<h2>Falling of the Womb.</h2>

  <p><b>Causes.</b>&mdash;The displacement of the womb usually is the
  result of too much childbearing, miscarriages, abortions, or the taking
  of strong medicines to bring about menstruation. It may also be the
  result in getting up too quickly from the childbed. There are, however,
  other causes, such as a general breaking down of the health.</p>

  <p><b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;If the womb has fallen forward it presses
  against the bladder, causing the patient to urinate frequently. If the
  womb has fallen back, it presses against the rectum, and constipation is
  the result with often severe pain at stool. If the womb descends into the
  vagina there is a feeling of heaviness. All forms of displacement produce
  pain in the back, with an irregular and scanty menstrual flow and a dull
  and exhausted feeling.</p>

  <p><b>Home Treatment.</b>&mdash;Improve the general health. Take some
  preparation of cod-liver oil, hot injections (of a teaspoonful of
  powdered alum with a pint of water), a daily sitz-bath, and a regular
  morning bath three times a week will be found very beneficial. There,
  however, can be no remedy unless the womb is first replaced to the proper
  position. This must be done by a competent physician who should
  frequently be consulted.</p>

  </div>
<p><!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page351"></a>[351]</span></p>

<h2>Menstruation.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Its Importance.</b>&mdash;Menstruation plays a momentous part in
  the female economy; indeed, unless it be in every way properly and duly
  performed, it is neither possible that a lady can be well, nor is it at
  all probable that she will conceive. The large number of barren, of
  delicate, and of hysterical women there are in America arises mainly from
  menstruation not being duly and properly performed.</p>

  <p>2. <b>The Boundary-Line.</b>&mdash;Menstruation&mdash;"the
  periods"&mdash;the appearance of the catamenia or the menses&mdash;is
  then one of the most important epochs in a girl's life. It is the
  boundary-line, the landmark between childhood and womanhood; it is the
  threshold, so to speak, of a woman's life. Her body now develops and
  expands, and her mental capacity enlarges and improves.</p>

  <p>3. <b>The Commencement of Menstruation.</b>&mdash;A good beginning at
  this time is peculiarly necessary, or a girl's health is sure to suffer,
  and different organs of the body&mdash;her lungs, for instance, may
  become imperiled. A healthy continuation, at regular periods, is also
  much needed, or conception, when she is married, may not occur. Great
  attention and skillful management is required to ward off many formidable
  diseases, which at the close of menstruation&mdash;at "the change of
  life"&mdash;are more likely than at any time to be developed. If she
  marry when very young, marriage weakens her system, and prevents a full
  development of her body. Moreover, such an one is, during the progress of
  her labor, prone to convulsions&mdash;which is a very serious childbed
  complication.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Early Marriages.</b>&mdash;Statistics prove that twenty per
  cent&mdash;20 in every 100&mdash;of females who marry are under age, and
  that such early marriages are often followed by serious, and sometimes
  even by fatal consequences to mother, to progeny, or to both. Parents
  ought, therefore, to persuade their daughters not to marry until they are
  of age&mdash;twenty-one; they should point out to them the risk and
  danger likely to ensue if their advice be not followed; they should
  impress upon their minds the old adage:</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Early wed,</p>
      <p>Early dead."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>5. <b>Time to Marry.</b>&mdash;Parents who have the real interest and
  happiness of their daughters at heart, ought, in consonance with the laws
  of physiology, to discountenance marriage before twenty; and the nearer
  the girls arrive at <!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page352"></a>[352]</span>the age of twenty-five before the
  consummation of this important rite, the greater the probability that,
  physically and morally, they will be protected against those risks which
  precocious marriages bring in their train.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Feeble Parents.</b>&mdash;Feeble parents have generally feeble
  children; diseased parents, diseased children; nervous parents, nervous
  children;&mdash;"like begets like." It is sad to reflect, that the
  innocent have to suffer, not only for the guilty, but for the thoughtless
  and inconsiderate. Disease and debility are thus propagated from one
  generation to another and the American race becomes woefully
  deteriorated.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Time.</b>&mdash;Menstruation in this country usually commences
  at the ages of from thirteen to sixteen, sometimes earlier; occasionally
  as early as eleven or twelve; at other times later, and not until a girl
  be seventeen or eighteen years of age. Menstruation in large towns is
  supposed to commence at an earlier period than in the country, and
  earlier in luxurious than in simple life.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Character.</b>&mdash;The menstrual fluid is not exactly blood,
  although, both in appearance and properties, it much resembles it; yet it
  never in the healthy state clots as blood does. It is a secretion of the
  womb, and, when healthy, ought to be of a bright red color, in appearance
  very much like the blood from a recently cut finger. The menstrual fluid
  ought not, as before observed, clot. If it does, a lady, during "her
  periods," suffers intense pain; moreover, she seldom conceives until the
  clotting has ceased.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Menstruation during Nursing.</b>&mdash;Some ladies, though
  comparatively few, menstruate during nursing; when they do, it may be
  considered not as the rule, but as the exception. It is said in such
  instances, that they are more likely to conceive; and no doubt they are,
  as menstruation is an indication of a proneness to conception. Many
  persons have an idea that when a woman, during lactation, menstruates,
  her milk is both sweeter and purer. Such is an error. Menstruation during
  nursing is more likely to weaken the mother, and consequently to
  deteriorate her milk, and thus make it less sweet and less pure.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Violent Exercise.</b>&mdash;During "the monthly periods"
  violent exercise is injurious; iced drinks and acid beverages are
  improper; and bathing in the sea, and bathing the feet in cold water, and
  cold baths are dangerous; indeed, at such times as these, no risks should
  be run, and no experiments should, for the moment, be permitted,
  otherwise serious consequences will, in all probability, ensue. <!-- Page
  353 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page353"></a>[353]</span></p>

  <p>11. <b>The Pale, Colorless-Complexioned.</b>&mdash;The pale,
  colorless-complexioned, helpless, listless, and almost lifeless young
  ladies who are so constantly seen in society, usually owe their miserable
  state of health to absent, to deficient, or to profuse menstruation.
  Their breathing is short&mdash;they are soon "out of breath," if they
  attempt to take exercise&mdash;to walk, for instance, either up stairs or
  up a hill, or even for half a mile on level ground, their breath is
  nearly exhausted&mdash;they pant as though they had been running quickly.
  They are ready, after the slightest exertion or fatigue, and after the
  least worry or excitement, to feel faint, and sometimes even to actually
  swoon away. Now such cases may, if judiciously treated, be generally soon
  cured. It therefore behooves mothers to seek medical aid early for their
  girls, and that before irreparable mischief has been done to the
  constitution.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Poverty of Blood.</b>&mdash;In a pale, delicate girl or wife,
  who is laboring under what is popularly called poverty of blood, the
  menstrual fluid is sometimes very scant, at others very copious, but is,
  in either case, usually very pale&mdash;almost as colorless as water, the
  patient being very nervous and even hysterical. Now, these are signs of
  great debility; but, fortunately for such an one, a medical man is, in
  the majority of cases, in possession of remedies that will soon make her
  all right again.</p>

  <p>13. <b>No Right to Marry.</b>&mdash;A delicate girl has no right until
  she be made strong, to marry. If she should marry, she will frequently,
  when in labor, not have strength, unless she has help, to bring a child
  into the world; which, provided she be healthy and well-formed, ought not
  to be. How graphically the Bible tells of delicate women not having
  strength to bring children into the world: "For the children are come to
  the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth."&mdash;2 Kings <span
  class="scac">XIX</span>, 3.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Too Sparing.</b>&mdash;Menstruation at another time is too
  sparing; this is a frequent cause of sterility. Medical aid, in the
  majority of cases, will be able to remedy the defect, and, by doing so,
  will probably be the means of bringing the womb into a healthy state, and
  thus predispose to conception.</p>

  wiping, and rub with glycerine. At night use cold cream, and wear
  gloves.</p>

<p class="cenhead">BLEEDING.</p>

  <p>Very hot water is a prompt checker of bleeding, besides, if it is
  clean, as it should be, it aids in sterilizing our wound.</p>

<p class="cenhead">TREATMENT FOR CRAMP.</p>

  <p>Wherever friction can be conveniently applied, heat will be generated
  by it, and the muscle again reduced to a natural condition; but if the
  pains proceed from the contraction of some muscle located internally,
  burnt brandy is an excellent remedy.</p>

  <p>A severe attack which will not yield to this simple treatment may be
  conquered by administering a small dose of laudanum or ether, best given
  under medical supervision.</p>

<p class="cenhead">TREATMENT FOR COLIC.</p>

  <p>Castor oil, given as soon as the symptoms of colic manifest
  themselves, has frequently afforded relief. At any rate, the irritating
  substances may be expelled from the alimentary canal before the pains
  will subside. All local remedies will be ineffectual, and consequently
  the purgative should be given in large doses until a copious vacuation is
  produced. <!-- Page 357 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="cenhead">TREATMENT FOR HEARTBURN.</p>

  <p>If soda, taken in small quantities after meals, does not relieve the
  distress, one may rest assured that the fluid is an alkali and requires
  an acid treatment. Proceed, after eating, to squeeze ten drops of
  lemon-juice into a small quantity of water, and swallow it. The habit of
  daily life should be made to conform to the laws of health, or local
  treatment will prove futile.</p>

<p class="cenhead">BILIOUSNESS.</p>

  <p>For biliousness, squeeze the juice of a lime or small lemon into half
  a glass of cold water, then stir in a little baking soda and drink while
  it foams. This receipt will also relieve sick headache if taken at the
  beginning.</p>

<p class="cenhead">TURPENTINE APPLICATIONS.</p>

  <p>Mix turpentine and lard in equal parts. Warmed and rubbed on the
  chest, it is a safe, reliable and mild counter irritant and revulsent in
  minor lung complications. <!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page358"></a>[358]</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">TREATMENT FOR MUMPS.</p>

  <p>It is very important that the face and neck be kept warm. Avoid
  catching cold, and regulate the stomach and bowels, because, when
  aggravated, this disease is communicated to other glands, and assumes
  there a serious form. Rest and quiet, with a good condition of the
  general health, will throw off this disease without further
  inconvenience.</p>

<p class="cenhead">TREATMENT FOR FELON.</p>

  <p>All medication, such as poulticing, anointing, and the applications of
  lotions, is but useless waste of time. The surgeon's knife should be used
  as early as possible, for it will be required sooner or later, and the
  more promptly it can be applied, the less danger is there from the
  disease, and the more agony is spared to the unfortunate victim.</p>

<p class="cenhead">TREATMENT FOR STABS.</p>

  <p>A wound made by thrusting a dagger or other oblong instrument into the
  flesh, is best treated, if no artery has been severed, by applying lint
  scraped from a linen cloth, which serves as an obstruction, allowing and
  assisting coagulation. Meanwhile cold water should be applied to the
  parts adjoining the wound.</p>

<p class="cenhead">TREATMENT FOR MASHED NAILS.</p>

  <p>If the injured member be plunged into very hot water, the nail will
  become pliable and adapt itself to the new condition of things, thus
  alleviating agony to some extent. A small hole may be bored on the nail
  with a pointed instrument, so adroitly so as not to cause pain, yet so
  successfully as to relieve pressure on the sensitive tissues. Free
  applications of arnica or iodine will have an excellent effect.</p>

<p class="cenhead">TREATMENT FOR FOREIGN BODY IN THE EYE.</p>

  <p>When any foreign body enters the eye, close it instantly, and keep it
  still until you have an opportunity to ask the assistance of some one;
  then have the upper lid folded over a pencil and the exposed surfaces
  closely searched; if the body be invisible, catch the everted lid by the
  lashes, and drawing it down over the lower lid, suddenly release it, and
  it will resume its natural position. Unsuccessful in this attempt, you
  may be pretty well assured that the object has become lodged in the
  tissues, and will require the assistance of a skilled operator to remove
  it.</p>

<p class="cenhead">CUTS.</p>

  <p>A drop or two of creosote on a cut will stop its bleeding. <!-- Page

  <p><b>Treatment for Poison Oak&mdash;Poison Ivy&mdash;Poison
  Sumach.</b>&mdash;Mr. Charles Morris, of Philadelphia, who has studied
  the subject closely, uses, as a sovereign remedy, frequent bathing of the
  affected parts in water as hot as can be borne. If used immediately after
  exposure, it may prevent the eruption appearing. If later, it allays the
  itching, and gradually dries up the swellings, though, they are very
  stubborn after they have once appeared. But an application every few
  hours keeps down the intolerable itching, which is the most annoying
  feature of sumach poisoning. In addition to this, the ordinary astringent
  ointments are useful, as is also that sovereign lotion, "lead-water and
  laudanum." Mr. Morris adds to these a preventive prescription of
  "wide-open eyes."</p>

  <p><b>Bites and Stings of Insects.</b>&mdash;Wash with a solution of
  ammonia water.</p>

  <p><b>Bites of Mad Dogs.</b>&mdash;Apply caustic potash at once to the
  wound, and give enough whiskey to cause sleep.</p>

  <p><b>Burns.</b>&mdash;Make a paste of common baking soda and water, and
  apply it promptly to the burn. It will quickly check the pain and
  inflammation.</p>

  <p><b>Cold on Chest.</b>&mdash;A flannel rag wrung out in boiling water
  and sprinkled with turpentine, laid on the chest, gives the greatest
  relief.</p>

  <p><b>Cough.</b>&mdash;Boil one ounce of flaxseed in a pint of water,
  strain, and add a little honey, one ounce of rock candy, and the juice of
  three lemons. Mix and boil well. Drink as hot as possible.</p>

  <p><b>Sprained Ankle or Wrist.</b>&mdash;Wash the ankle very frequently
  with cold salt and water, which is far better than warm vinegar or
  decoction of herbs. Keep the foot as cool as possible to prevent
  inflammation, and sit with it elevated on a high cushion. Live on low
  diet, and take every morning some cooling medicine, such as Epsom salts.
  It cures in a few days.</p>

  <p><b>Chilblains, Sprains, etc.</b>&mdash;One raw egg well beaten, half a
  pint of vinegar, one ounce spirits of turpentine, a quarter of an ounce
  of spirits of wine, a quarter of an ounce of camphor. These ingredients
  to be beaten together, then put in a bottle and shaken for ten minutes,
  after which, to be corked down tightly to exclude the air. In half an
  hour it is fit for use. To be well rubbed in, two, three, or four times a
  day. For rheumatism in the head, to be rubbed at the back of the neck and
  behind the ears. In chilblains this remedy is to be used before they are
  broken. <!-- Page 360 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page360"></a>[360]</span></p>

  <p><b>How To Remove Superfluous Hair.</b>&mdash;Sulphuret of Arsenic, one
  ounce; Quicklime, one ounce; Prepared Lard, one ounce; White Wax, one
  ounce. Melt the Wax, add the Lard. When nearly cold, stir in the other
  ingredients. Apply to the superfluous hair, allowing it to remain on from
  five to ten minutes; use a table-knife to shave off the hair; then wash
  with soap and warm water.</p>

  <p><b>Dyspepsia Cure.</b>&mdash;Powdered Rhubarb, two drachms;
  Bicarbonate of Sodium, six drachms; Fluid Extract of Gentian, three
  drachms; Peppermint Water, seven and a half ounces. Mix them. Dose, a
  teaspoonful half an hour before meals.</p>

  <p><b>For Neuralgia.</b>&mdash;Tincture of Belladonna, one ounce;
  Tincture of Camphor, one ounce; Tincture of Arnica, one ounce; Tincture
  of Opium, one ounce. Mix them. Apply over the seat of the pain, and give
  ten to twenty drops in sweetened water every two hours.</p>

  <p><b>For Coughs, Colds, etc.</b>&mdash;Syrup of Morphia, three ounces;
  Syrup of Tar, three and a half ounces; Chloroform, one troy ounce;
  Glycerine, one troy ounce. Mix them. Dose, a teaspoonful three or four
  times a day.</p>

  <p><b>To Cure Hives.</b>&mdash;Compound syrup of Squill, U. S., three
  ounces; Syrup of Ipecac, U. S., one ounce. Mix them. Dose, a
  teaspoonful.</p>

  <p><b>To Cure Sick Headache.</b>&mdash;Gather sumach leaves in the
  summer, and spread them in the sun a few days to dry. Then powder them
  fine, and smoke, morning and evening for two weeks, also whenever there
  are symptoms of approaching headache. Use a new clay pipe. If these
  directions are adhered to, this medicine will surely effect a permanent
  cure.</p>

  <p><b>Whooping Cough.</b>&mdash;Dissolve a scruple of salt of tartar in a
  gill of water; add to it ten grains of cochineal; sweeten it with sugar.
  Give to an infant a quarter teaspoonful four times a day; two years old,
  one-half teaspoonful; from four years, a tablespoonful. Great care is
  required in the administration of medicines to infants. We can assure
  paternal inquirers that the foregoing may be depended upon.</p>

  <p><b>Cut or Bruise.</b>&mdash;Apply the moist surface of the inside
  coating or skin of the shell of a raw egg. It will adhere of itself,
  leave no scar, and heal without pain.</p>

  <p><b>Disinfectant.</b>&mdash;Chloride of lime should be scattered at
  least once a week under sinks and wherever sewer gas is likely to
  penetrate.</p>

  <p><b>Costiveness.</b>&mdash;Common charcoal is highly recommended for
  costiveness. It may be taken in tea- or tablespoonful, or even larger
  doses, according to the exigencies of the case, mixed with molasses,
  repeating it as often as necessary. Bathe the bowels with pepper and
  vinegar. Or take two ounces of rhubarb, add one ounce of rust of iron,
  infuse in one quart of wine. Half a wineglassful every morning. Or take
  pulverized blood root, one drachm, pulverized rhubarb, one drachm,
  castile soap, two scruples. Mix. and roll into thirty-two pills. Take
  one, morning and night. By following these directions it may perhaps save
  you from a severe attack of the piles, or some other kindred disease.</p>

  <p><b>To Cure Deafness.</b>&mdash;Obtain pure pickerel oil, and apply
  four drops morning and evening to the ear. Great care should be taken to
  obtain oil that is perfectly pure.</p>

  <p><b>Deafness.</b>&mdash;Take three drops of sheep's gall, warm, and
  drop it into the ear on going to bed. The ear must be syringed with warm
  soap and water in the morning. The gall must be applied for three
  successive nights. It is only efficacious when the deafness is produced
  by cold. The most convenient way of warming the gall is by holding it in
  a silver spoon over the flame of a light. The above remedy has been
  frequently tried with perfect success.</p>

  <p><b>Gout.</b>&mdash;This is Col. Birch's recipe for rheumatic gout or
  acute rheumatism, commonly called in England the "Chelsea Pensioner."
  Half an ounce of nitre (saltpetre), half an ounce of sulphur, half an
  ounce of flour of mustard, half an ounce of Turkey rhubarb, quarter of an
  ounce of powdered guaicum. Mix, and take a teaspoonful every other night
  for three nights, and omit three nights, in a wine-glassful of cold water
  which has been previously well boiled.</p>

  <p><b>Ringworm.</b>&mdash;The head is to be washed twice a day with soft
  soap and warm soft water; when dried the places to be rubbed with a piece
  of linen rag dipped in ammonia from gas tar; the patient should take a
  little sulphur and molasses, or some other genuine aperient, every
  morning; brushes and combs should be washed every day, and the ammonia
  kept tightly corked.</p>

  <p><b>Piles.</b>&mdash;Hamamelis, both internally or as an injection in
  rectum. Bathe the parts with cold water or with astringent lotions, as
  alum water, especially in bleeding piles. Ointment of gallic acid and
  calomel is of repute. The best treatment of all is, suppositories of
  iodoform, ergotine, or tannic acid, which can be made at any drug store.
  <!-- Page 363 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page363"></a>[363]</span></p>

  <p><b>Chicken Pox.</b>&mdash;No medicine is usually needed, except a tea
  made from pleurisy root, to make the child sweat. Milk diet is the best;
  avoidance of animal food; careful attention to the bowels; keep cool and
  avoid exposure to cold.</p>

  <p><b>Scarlet Fever.</b>&mdash;Cold water compress on the throat. Fats
  and oils rubbed on hands and feet. The temperature of the room should be
  about 68 degrees Fahr., and all draughts avoided. Mustard baths for
  retrocession of the rash and to bring it out. Diet: ripe fruit, toast,
  gruel, beef tea and milk. Stimulants are useful to counteract depression
  of the vital forces.</p>

  <p><b>False Measles or Rose Rash.</b>&mdash;It requires no treatment
  except hygienic. Keep the bowels open. Nourishing diet, and if there is
  itching, moisten the skin with five per cent. solution of aconite or
  solution of starch and water.</p>

  <p><b>Bilious Attacks.</b>&mdash;Drop doses of muriatic acid in a wine
  glass of water every four hours, or the following prescription.
  Bicarbonate of soda, one drachm; Aromatic spirits of ammonia, two
  drachms; Peppermint water, four ounces. Dose: Take a teaspoonful every
  four hours.</p>

  <p><b>Diarrh&oelig;a.</b>&mdash;The following prescription is generally
  all that will be necessary: acetate of lead, eight grains; gum arabic,
  two drachms; acetate of morphia, one grain; and cinnamon water, eight
  ounces. Take a teaspoonful every three hours.</p>

  <p>Be careful not to eat too much food. Some consider, the best treatment
  is to fast, and it is a good suggestion. Patients should keep quiet and
  have the room of a warm and even temperature.</p>

  <p><b>Vomiting.</b>&mdash;Ice dissolved in the mouth, often cures
  vomiting when all remedies fail. Much depends on the diet of persons
  liable to such attacks; this should be easily digestible food, taken
  often and in small quantities. Vomiting can often be arrested by applying
  a mustard paste over the region of the stomach. It is not necessary to
  allow it to remain until the parts are blistered, but it may be removed
  when the part becomes thoroughly red, and reapplied if required after the
  redness has disappeared. One of the secrets to relieve vomiting is to
  give the stomach perfect rest, not allowing the patient even a glass of
  water, as long as the tendency remains to throw it up again.</p>

  <p><b>Nervous Headache.</b>&mdash;Extract hyoscymus five grains,
  pulverized camphor five grains. Mix. Make four pills, one to be taken
  when the pain is most severe in nervous headache. Or three drops tincture
  nux vomica in a spoonful of water, two or three times a day. <!-- Page
  364 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page364"></a>[364]</span></p>

  <p><b>Bleeding from the Nose,</b>&mdash;from whatever cause&mdash;may
  generally be stopped by putting a plug of lint into the nostril; if this
  does not do, apply a cold lotion to the forehead; raise the head and
  place both arms over the head, so that it will rest on both hands; dip
  the lint plug, slightly moistened, in some powdered gum arabic, and plug
  the nostrils again; or dip the plug into equal parts of gum arabic and
  alum. An easier and simpler method is to place a piece of writing paper
  on the gums of the upper jaw, under the upper lip, and let it remain
  there for a few minutes.</p>

  <p><b>Boils.</b>&mdash;These should be brought to a head by warm
  poultices of camomile flowers, or boiled white lily root, or onion root,
  by fermentation with hot water, or by stimulating plasters. When ripe
  they should be destroyed by a needle or lancet. But this should not be
  attempted until they are thoroughly proved.</p>

  <p><b>Bunions</b> may be checked in their early development by binding
  the joint with adhesive plaster, and keeping it on as long as any
  uneasiness is felt. The bandaging should be perfect, and it might be well
  to extend it round the foot. An inflamed bunion should be poulticed, and
  larger shoes be worn. Iodine 12 grains, lard or spermaceti ointment half
  an ounce, makes a capital ointment for bunions. It should be rubbed on
  gently twice or three times a day.</p>

  <p><b>Felons.</b>&mdash;One table-spoonful of red lead, and one
  table-spoonful of castile soap, and mix them with as much weak lye as
  will make it soft enough to spread like a salve, and apply it on the
  first appearance of the felon, and it will cure in ten or twelve
  days.</p>

  <p><b>Cure for Warts.</b>&mdash;The easiest way to get rid of warts, is
  to pare off the thickened skin which covers the prominent wart; cut it
  off by successive layers and shave it until you come to the surface of
  the skin, and till you draw blood in two or three places. Then rub the
  part thoroughly over with lunar caustic, and one effective operation of
  this kind will generally destroy the wart; if not, you cut off the black
  spot which has been occasioned by the caustic, and apply it again; or you
  may apply acetic acid, and thus you will get rid of it. Care must be
  taken in applying these acids, not to rub them on the skin around the
  wart.</p>

  <p><b>Wens.</b>&mdash;Take the yoke of some eggs, beat up, and add as
  much fine salt as will dissolve, and apply a plaster to the wen every ten
  hours. It cures without pain or any other inconvenience.</p>

<h3>HOW TO CURE</h3>

<h2>Apoplexy, Bad Breath and
Quinsy.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Apoplexy.</b>&mdash;Apoplexy occurs only in the corpulent or
  obese, and those of gross or high living.</p>

  <p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Raise the head to a nearly upright position;
  loosen all tight clothes, strings, etc., and apply cold water to the head
  and warm water and warm cloths to the feet. Have the apartment cool and
  well ventilated. Give nothing by the mouth until the breathing is
  relieved, and then only draughts of cold water.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Bad Breath.</b>&mdash;Bad or foul breath will be removed by
  taking a teaspoonful of the following mixture after each meal: One ounce
  chloride of soda, one ounce liquor of potassa, one and one-half ounces
  phosphate of soda, and three ounces of water.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Quinsy.</b>&mdash;This is an inflammation of the tonsils, or
  common inflammatory sore throat; commences with a slight feverish attack,
  with considerable pain and swelling of the tonsils, causing some
  difficulty in swallowing; as the attack advances, these symptoms become
  more intense, there is headache, thirst, a painful sense of tension, and
  acute darting pains in the ears. The attack is generally brought on by
  exposure to cold, and lasts from five to seven days, when it subsides
  naturally, or an abscess may form in tonsils and burst, or the tonsils
  may remain enlarged, the inflammation subsiding.</p>

  <p><i>Home Treatment.</i>&mdash;The patient should remain in a warm room,
  the diet chiefly milk and good broths, some cooling laxative and
  diaphoretic medicine may be given; but the greatest relief will be found
  in the frequent inhalation of the steam of hot water through an inhaler,
  or in the old-fashioned way through the spout of a teapot.</p>

<h2>Sensible Rules for the Nurse.</h2>

  <p>"Remember to be extremely neat in dress; a few drops of hartshorn in
  the water used for <i>daily</i> bathing will remove the disagreeable
  odors of warmth and perspiration.</p>

  <p>"Never speak of the symptoms of your patient in his presence, unless
  questioned by the doctor, whose orders you are always to obey
  <i>implicitly</i>.</p>

  <p>"Remember never to be a gossip or tattler, and always to hold sacred
  the knowledge which, to a certain extent, you must obtain of the private
  affairs of your patient and the household in which you nurse.</p>

  <p>"Never contradict your patient, nor argue with him, nor let him see
  that you are annoyed about anything.</p>

  <p>"Never <i>whisper</i> in the sick room. If your patient be well
  enough, and wishes you to talk to him, speak in a low, distinct voice, on
  cheerful subjects. Don't relate painful hospital experiences, nor give
  details of the maladies of former patients, and remember never to startle
  him with accounts of dreadful crimes or accidents that you have read in
  the newspapers.</p>

  <p>"<i>Write</i> down the orders that the physician gives you as to time
  for giving the medicines, food, etc.</p>

  <p>"Keep the room bright (unless the doctor orders it darkened).</p>

  <p>"Let the air of the room be as pure as possible, and keep everything
  in order, but without being fussy and bustling.</p>

  <p>"The only way to remove dust in a sick room is to wipe everything with
  a damp cloth.</p>

  <p>"Remember to carry out all vessels covered. Empty and wash them
  immediately, and keep some disinfectant in them.</p>

  <p>"Remember that to leave the patient's untasted food by his side, from
  meal to meal, in hopes that he will eat it in the interval, is simply to
  prevent him from taking any food at all.</p>

  <p>"Medicines, beef tea or stimulants, should never be kept where the
  patient can see them or smell them.</p>

  <p>"Light-colored clothing should be worn by those who have the care of
  the sick, in preference to dark-colored apparel; particularly if the
  disease is of a contagious nature. Experiments have shown that black and
  other dark colors will absorb more readily the subtle effluvia that
  emanates from sick persons than white or light colors."</p>

  <p>"It will be easily seen, by these figures, how a quiet or tranquil
  life affects longevity. The phlegmatic man will live longer, all other
  things being equal, than the sanguine, nervous individual. Marriage is
  favorable to longevity, and it has also been ascertained that women live
  longer than men." <!-- Page 368 --><span class="pagenum"><a

    HOT WATER THROAT BAG. HOT WATER BAG.
  </div>
<h2>HOW TO APPLY AND USE HOT WATER IN ALL
DISEASES.</h2>

  <p>1. <span class="sc">The Hot Water Throat Bag</span>. The hot water
  throat bag is made from fine white rubber fastened to the head by a
  rubber band (see illustration), and is an unfailing remedy for catarrh,
  hay fever, cold, toothache, headache, earache, neuralgia, etc.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="sc">The Hot Water Bottle</span>. No well regulated
  house should be without a hot water bottle. It is excellent in the
  application of hot water for inflammations, colic, headache, congestion,
  cold feet, rheumatism, sprains, etc., etc. It is an excellent warming pan
  and an excellent feet and hand warmer when riding. These hot water bags
  in any variety can be purchased at any drug store.</p>

  <p>3. Boiling water may be used in the bags and the heat will be retained
  many hours. They are soft and pliable and pleasant to the touch, and can
  be adjusted to any part of the body.</p>

  <p>4. Hot water is good for constipation, torpid liver, and relieves
  colic and flatulence, and is of special value.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Caution</i>. When hot water bags or any hot fomentation <!--
  Page 369 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page369"></a>[369]</span>is
  removed, replace dry flannel and bathe parts in tepid water and rub till
  dry.</p>

  <p>6. By inflammations it is best to use hot water and then cold water.
  It seems to give more immediate relief. Hot water is a much better remedy
  than drugs, paragoric, Dover's powder or morphine. Always avoid the use
  of strong poisonous drugs when possible.</p>

  <p>7. Those who suffer from cold feet there is no better remedy than to
  bathe the feet in cold water before retiring and then place a hot water
  bottle in the bed at the feet. A few weeks of such treatment results in
  relief if not cure of the most obstinate case.</p>

<hr class="full" >

<h2>HOW TO USE COLD WATER.</h2>

  <p>Use a compress of cold water for acute or chronic inflammation, such
  as sore throat, bronchitis, croup, inflammation of the lungs, etc. If
  there is a hot and aching pain in the back apply a compress of cold water
  on the same, or it may simply be placed across the back or around the
  body. The most depends upon the condition of the patient.</p>

<h2>Practical Rules for Bathing.</h2>

      <a href="images/gs371.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/371.jpg"
      alt="Sea Bathing." title="Sea Bathing." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>1. Bathe at least once a week all over, thoroughly. No one can
  preserve his health by neglecting personal cleanliness. Remember,
  "Cleanliness is akin to Godliness."</p>

  <p>2. Only mild soap should be used in bathing the body.</p>

  <p>3. Wipe quickly and dry the body thoroughly with a moderately coarse
  towel. Rub the skin vigorously. <!-- Page 371 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page371"></a>[371]</span></p>

  <p>4. Many people have contracted severe and fatal diseases by neglecting
  to take proper care of the body after bathing.</p>

  <p>5. If you get up a good reaction by thorough rubbing in a mild
  temperature, the effect is always good.</p>

  <p>6. Never go into a cold room, or allow cold air to enter the room
  until you are dressed.</p>

  <p>7. Bathing in cold rooms and in cold water is positively injurious,
  unless the person possesses a very strong and vigorous constitution, and
  then there is great danger of laying the foundation of some serious
  disease.</p>

  <p>8. Never bathe within two hours after eating. It injures
  digestion.</p>

  <p>9. Never bathe when the body or mind is much exhausted. It is liable
  to check the healthful circulation.</p>

  <p>10. A good time for bathing is just before retiring. The morning hour
  is a good time also, if a warm room and warm water can be secured.</p>

  <p>11. Never bathe a fresh wound or broken skin with cold water; the
  wound absorbs water, and causes swelling and irritation.</p>

  <p>12. A person not robust should be very careful in bathing; great care
  should be exercised to avoid any chilling effects.</p>

<h2>All the Different Kinds of Baths,
and How to Prepare Them.</h2>

<h3>THE SULPHUR BATH.</h3>

  <p>For the itch, ringworm, itching, and for other slight skin
  irritations, bathe in water containing a little sulphur.</p>

<h3>THE SALT BATH.</h3>

  <p>To open the pores of the skin, put a little common salt into the
  water. Borax, baking soda or lime used in the same way are excellent for
  cooling and cleansing the skin. A very small quantity in a bowl of water
  is sufficient.</p>

<h3>THE VAPOR BATH.</h3>

  <p>1. For catarrh, bronchitis, pleurisy, inflammation of the lungs,
  rheumatism, fever, affections of the bowels and kidneys, and skin
  diseases, the vapor-bath is an excellent remedy.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="sc">Apparatus</span>.&mdash;Use a small alcohol lamp,
  and place over it a small dish containing water. Light the lamp and allow
  the water to boil. Place a cane-bottom chair over the lamp, and seat the
  patient on it. Wrap blankets or quilts around the chair and around the
  patient, closing it tightly about the neck. After free perspiration is
  produced the patient should be wrapped in warm blankets, and placed in
  bed, so as to continue the perspiration for some time.</p>

  <p>3. A convenient alcohol lamp may be made by taking a tin box, placing
  a tube in it, and putting in a common lamp wick. Any tinner can make one
  in a few minutes, at a trifling cost.</p>

<h3>THE HOT-AIR BATH.</h3>

  <p>1. Place the alcohol lamp under the chair, without the dish of water.
  Then place the patient on the chair, as in the vapor bath, and let him
  remain until a gentle and free perspiration is produced. This bath may be
  taken from time to time, as may be deemed necessary.</p>

  <p>2. While remaining in the hot-air bath the patient may drink freely of
  cold or tepid water.</p>

  <p>3. As soon as the bath is over the patient should be washed with hot
  water and soap.</p>

  <p>4. The hot-air bath is excellent for colds, skin diseases, and the
  gout. <!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page373"></a>[373]</span></p>

<h3>THE SPONGE BATH.</h3>

  <p>1. Have a large basin of water of the temperature of 88 or 95 degrees.
  As soon as the patient rises rub the body over with a soft, dry towel
  until it becomes warm.</p>

  <p>2. Now sponge the body with water and a little soap, at the same time
  keeping the body well covered, except such portions as are necessarily
  exposed. Then dry the skin carefully with a soft, warm towel. Rub the
  skin well for two or three minutes, until every part becomes red and
  perfectly dry.</p>

  <p>3. Sulphur, lime or salt, and sometimes mustard, may be used in any of
  the sponge baths, according to the disease.</p>

<h3>THE FOOT BATH.</h3>

  <p>1. The foot bath, in coughs, colds, asthma, headaches and fevers, is
  excellent. One or two tablespoonfuls of ground mustard added to a gallon
  of hot water, is very beneficial.</p>

  <p>2. Heat the water as hot as the patient can endure it, and gradually
  increase the temperature by pouring in additional quantities of hot water
  during the bath.</p>

<h3>THE SITZ BATH.</h3>

  <p>A tub is arranged so that the patient can sit down in it while
  bathing. Fill the tub about one-half full of water. This is an excellent
  remedy for piles, constipation, headache, gravel, and for acute and
  inflammatory affections generally.</p>

<h3>THE ACID BATH.</h3>

  <p>Place a little vinegar in water, and heat to the usual temperature.
  This is an excellent remedy for the disorders of the liver.</p>

<hr class="short" >

<h3>A Sure Cure for Prickly Heat.</h3>

  <p>1. Prickly heat is caused by hot weather, by excess of flesh, by rough
  flannels, by sudden changes of temperature, or by over-fatigue.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="sc">Treatment</span>&mdash;Bathe two or three times a
  day with warm water, in which a moderate quantity of bran and common soda
  has been stirred. After wiping the skin dry, dust the affected parts with
  common cornstarch.</p>

  water, and boil three minutes.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Sago Gruel.</b>&mdash;Take two tablespoonfuls of sago and place
  them in a small saucepan, moisten gradually with a little cold water. Set
  the preparation on a slow fire, and keep stirring till it becomes rather
  stiff and clear. Add a little grated nutmeg and sugar to taste; if
  preferred, half a pat of butter may also be added with the sugar.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Cream Gruel.</b>&mdash;Put a pint and a half of water on the
  stove in a saucepan. Take one tablespoon of flour and the same of
  cornmeal; mix this with cold water, and as soon as the water in the

  minutes, stirring constantly; then add a little salt and a gill of sweet
  cream. Do not let it boil after putting in the cream, but turn into a
  bowl and cover tightly. Serve in a pretty cup and saucer. <!-- Page 376

  or bowels.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Beef Tea.</b>&mdash;For every quart of tea desired use one
  pound of fresh beef, from which all fat, bones and sinews have been
  carefully removed; cut the beef into pieces a quarter of an inch thick

  glass fruit can and place in a vessel of water; let it heat on the stove
  another hour, but do not let it boil. Strain before using. <!-- Page 377

  white of one egg. Beat till the mixture will hold on your spoon. Serve
  with soft custard.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Eggs on Toast.</b>&mdash;Soften brown bread toast with hot
  water, put on a platter and cover with poached or scrambled eggs.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Boiled Eggs.</b>&mdash;An egg should never be boiled. Place in
  boiling water and set back on the stove for from seven to ten minutes. A
  little experience will enable anyone to do it successfully.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Cracked Wheat Pudding.</b>&mdash;In a deep two-quart pudding
  dish put layers of cold, cooked, cracked wheat, and tart apples sliced
  thin, with four tablespoonfuls of sugar. Raisins can be added if
  preferred. Fill the dish, having the wheat last, add a cup of cold water.
  Bake two hours.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Pie for Dyspeptics.</b>&mdash;Four tablespoonfuls of oatmeal,
  one pint of water; let stand for a few hours, or until the meal is
  swelled. Then add two large apples, pared and sliced, a little salt, one
  cup of sugar, one tablespoonful of flour. Mix all well together and bake
  in a buttered dish; makes a most delicious pie, which can be eaten with
  safety by the sick or well.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Apple Tapioca Pudding.</b>&mdash;Soak a teacup of tapioca in a
  quart of warm water three hours. Cut in thin slices six tart apples, stir
  them lightly with the tapioca, add half cup sugar. Bake three hours. To
  be eaten with whipped cream. Good either warm or cold. <!-- Page 379
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page379"></a>[379]</span></p>

  <p>14. <b>Graham Muffins.</b>&mdash;Take one pint of new milk, one pint
  graham or entire wheat flour; stir together and add one beaten egg. Can
  be baked in any kind of gem pans or muffin rings. Salt must not be used
  with any bread that is made light with egg.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Strawberry Dessert.</b>&mdash;Place alternate layers of hot
  cooked cracked wheat and strawberries in a deep dish; when cold, turn out
  on platter; cut in slices and serve with cream and sugar, or strawberry
  juice. Wet the molds with cold water before using. This, molded in small
  cups, makes a dainty dish for the sick. Wheatlet can be used in the same
  way.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Fruit Blanc Mange.</b>&mdash;One quart of juice of
  strawberries, cherries, grapes or other juicy fruit; one cup water. When
  boiling, add two tablespoonfuls sugar and four tablespoonfuls cornstarch
  wet in cold water; let boil five or six minutes, then mold in small cups.
  Serve without sauce, or with cream or boiled custard. Lemon juice can be
  used the same, only requiring more water. This is a very valuable dish
  for convalescents and pregnant women, where the stomach rejects solid
  food.</p>

  <p>1. <b>Public Balls.</b>&mdash;The church should turn its face like
  flint against the public ball. Its influence is evil, and nothing but
  evil. It is a well known fact that in all cities and large towns the ball
  room is the recruiting office for prostitution.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Thoughtless Young Women.</b>&mdash;In cities public balls are
  given every night, and many thoughtless young women, <!-- Page 381
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page381"></a>[381]</span>mostly the
  daughters of small tradesmen and mechanics, or clerks or laborers, are
  induced to attend "just for fun." Scarcely one in a hundred of the girls
  attending these balls preserve their purity. They meet the most desperate
  characters, professional gamblers, criminals and the lowest debauchees.
  Such an assembly and such influence cannot mean anything but ruin for an
  innocent girl.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Vile Women.</b>&mdash;The public ball is always a resort of vile
  women who picture to innocent girls the ease and luxury of a harlot's
  life, and offer them all manner of temptations to abandon the paths of
  virtue. The public ball is the resort of the libertine and the adulterer,
  and whose object is to work the ruin of every innocent girl that may fall
  into their clutches.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Question.</b>&mdash;Why does society wonder at the increase
  of prostitution, when the public balls and promiscuous dancing is so
  largely endorsed and encouraged?</p>

  <p>5. <b>Working Girls.</b>&mdash;Thousands of innocent working girls
  enter innocently and unsuspectingly into the paths which lead them to the
  house of evil, or who wander the streets as miserable outcasts all
  through the influence of the dance. The low theatre and dance halls and
  other places of unselected gatherings are the milestones which mark the
  working girl's downward path from virtue to vice, from modesty to
  shame.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Saleswoman</b>, the seamstress, the factory girl or any
  other virtuous girl had better, far better, die than take the first step
  in the path of impropriety and danger. Better, a thousand times better,
  better for this life, better for the life to come, an existence of
  humble, virtuous industry than a single departure from virtue, even
  though it were paid with a fortune.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Temptations.</b>&mdash;There is not a young girl but what is
  more or less tempted by some unprincipled wretch who may have the
  reputation of a genteel society man. It behooves parents to guard
  carefully the morals of their daughters, and be vigilant and cautious in
  permitting them to accept the society of young men. Parents who desire to
  save their daughters from a fate which is worse than death, should
  endeavor by every means in their power to keep them from falling into
  traps cunningly devised by some cunning lover. There are many good young
  men, but not all are safe friends to an innocent, confiding young
  girl.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Prostitution.</b>&mdash;Some girls inherit their vicious
  tendency; others fall because of misplaced affections; many sin through a
  love of dress, which is fostered by society and <!-- Page 382 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page382"></a>[382]</span>by the surroundings
  amidst which they may be placed; many, very many, embrace a life of shame
  to escape poverty. While each of these different phases of prostitution
  require a different remedy, we need better men, better women, better laws
  and better protection for the young girls.</p>

    A RUSSIAN SPINNING GIRL.
  </div>
  <p>9. <b>A Startling Fact.</b>&mdash;Startling as it may seem to some, it
  is a fact in our large cities that there are many girls raised <!-- Page
  383 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page383"></a>[383]</span>by parents
  with no other aim than to make them harlots. At a tender age they are
  sold by fathers and mothers into an existence which is worse than slavery
  itself. It is not uncommon to see girls at the tender age of thirteen or
  fourteen&mdash;mere children&mdash;hardened courtesans, lost to all sense
  of shame and decency. They are reared in ignorance, surrounded by
  demoralizing influences, cut off from the blessings of church and Sabbath
  school, see nothing but licentiousness, intemperance and crime. These
  young girls are lost forever. They are beyond the reach of the moralist
  or preacher and have no comprehension of modesty and purity. Virtue to
  them is a stranger, and has been from the cradle.</p>

  <p>10. <b>A Great Wrong.</b>&mdash;Parents too poor to clothe themselves
  bring children into the world, children for whom they have no bread,
  consequently the girl easily falls a victim in early womanhood to the
  heartless libertine. The boy with no other schooling but that of the
  streets soon masters all the qualifications for a professional criminal.
  If there could be a law forbidding people to marry who have no visible
  means of supporting a family, or if they should marry, if their children
  could be taken from them and properly educated by the State, it would
  cost the country less and be a great step in advancing our
  civilization.</p>

  <p>11. <b>The First Step.</b>&mdash;Thousands of fallen women could have
  been saved from lives of degradation and deaths of shame had they
  received more toleration and loving forgiveness in their first steps of
  error. Many women naturally pure and virtuous have fallen to the lowest
  depths because discarded by friends, frowned upon by society, and sneered
  at by the world, after they had taken a single mis-step. Society forgives
  man, but woman never.</p>

  <p>12. <b>In the beginning</b> of every girl's downward career there is
  necessarily a hesitation. She naturally ponders over what course to take,
  dreading to meet friends and looking into the future with horror. That
  moment is the vital turning point in her career; a kind word of
  forgiveness, a mother's embrace a father's welcome may save her. The
  bloodhounds, known as the seducer, the libertine, the procurer, are upon
  her track; she is trembling on the frightful brink of the abyss. Extend a
  helping hand and save her!</p>

  <p>13. <b>Father</b>, if your daughter goes astray, do not drive her from
  your home. Mother, if your child errs, do not close your heart against
  her. Sisters and brothers and friends, do not force her into the pathway
  of shame, but rather strive to win her back into the Eden of virtue, and
  in nine cases out of ten you will succeed. <!-- Page 384 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page384"></a>[384]</span></p>

  <p>14. <b>Society Evils.</b>&mdash;The dance, the theater, the wine-cup,
  the race-course, the idle frivolity and luxury of summer watering places,
  all have a tendency to demoralize the young.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Bad Society.</b>&mdash;Much of our modern society admits
  libertines and seducers to the drawing-room, while it excludes their
  helpless and degraded victims, consequently it is not strange that there
  are skeletons in many closets, matrimonial infelicity and wayward
  girls.</p>

  <p>16. <b>"'Know Thyself,'</b> says Dr. Saur, "is an important maxim for
  us all, and especially is it true for girls.</p>

  <p>"All are born with the desire to become attractive&mdash;girls
  especially want to grow up, not only attractive, but beautiful. Some
  girls think that bright eyes, pretty hair and fine clothes alone make
  them beautiful. This is not so. Real beauty depends upon good health,
  good manners and a pure mind.</p>

  <p>"As the happiness of our girls depends upon their health, it behoves
  us all to guide the girls in such a way as to bring forward the best of
  results.</p>

  <p>17. <b>"There Is No One</b> who stands so near the girl as the mother.
  From early childhood she occupies the first place in the little one's
  confidence&mdash;she laughs, plays, and corrects, when necessary, the
  faults of her darling. She should be equally ready to guide in the
  important laws of life and health upon which rest her future. Teach your
  daughters that in all things the 'creative principle' has its source in
  life itself. It originates from Divine life, and when they know that it
  may be consecrated to wise and useful purposes, they are never apt to
  grow up with base thoughts or form bad habits. Their lives become a
  happiness to themselves and a blessing to humanity.</p>

  <p>18. <b>Teach Wisely.</b>&mdash;"Teach your daughters that <i>all
  life</i> originates from a seed&mdash;a germ. Knowing this law, you need
  have no fears that base or unworthy thoughts of the reproductive function
  can ever enter their minds. The growth, development and ripening of human
  seed becomes a beautiful and sacred mystery. The tree, the rose and all
  plant life are equally as mysterious and beautiful in their reproductive
  life. Does not this alone prove to us, conclusively, that there is a
  Divinity in the background governing, controlling and influencing our
  lives? Nature has no secrets, and why should we? None at all. The only
  care we should experience is in teaching wisely. <!-- Page 385 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page385"></a>[385]</span></p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;lead them wisely&mdash;teach them that the seed, the germ
  of a new life, is maturing within them. Teach them that between the ages
  of eleven and fourteen this maturing process has certain physical signs.
  The breasts grow round and full, the whole body, even the voice,
  undergoes a change. It is right that they should be taught the natural
  law of life in reproduction and the physiological structure of their
  being. Again we repeat that these lessons should be taught by the mother,
  and in a tender, delicate and confidential way. Become, oh, mother, your
  daughter's companion, and she will not go elsewhere for this
  knowledge&mdash;which must come to all in time, but possibly too late and
  through sources that would prove more harm than good.</p>

  <p>19. <b>The Organs of Creative Life</b> in women are: Ovaries,
  Fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina and mammary glands. The <i>ovaries</i>
  and <i>Fallopian tubes</i> have already been described under "The Female
  Generative Organs."</p>

  <p>"The <i>uterus</i> is a pear-shaped muscular organ, situated in the
  lower portion of the pelvis, between the bladder and the rectum. It is
  less than three inches in length and two inches in width and one in
  thickness.</p>

  <p>"The <i>vagina</i> is a membranous canal which joins the internal
  outlet with the womb, which projects slightly into it. The opening into
  the vagina is nearly oval, and in those who have never indulged in sexual
  intercourse or in handling the sexual organs is more or less closed by a
  membrane termed the <i>hymen</i>. The presence of this membrane was
  formerly considered as undoubted evidence of virginity; its absence, a
  lack of chastity.</p>

  <p>"The <i>mammary glands</i> are accessory to the generative organs.
  They secrete milk, which the All-wise Father provided for the nourishment
  of the child after birth.</p>

  <p>20. <b>"Menstruation</b>, which appears about the age of thirteen
  years, is the flow from the uterus that occurs every month as the
  seed-germ ripens in the ovaries. God made the sexual organs so that the
  race should not die out. He gave them to us so that we may reproduce
  life, and thus fill the highest position in the created universe. The
  purpose for which they are made is high and holy and honorable, and if
  they are used only for this purpose&mdash;and they must not be used at
  all until they are fully matured&mdash;they will be a source of greatest
  blessing to us all.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

      alt="Hopeful Youth." title="Hopeful Youth." /></a>
    HOPEFUL YOUTH.
  </div>
  <p>21. <b>"A Careful Study</b> of this organ, of its location, of its
  arteries and nerves, will convince the growing girl that <!-- Page 387
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page387"></a>[387]</span>her body
  should never submit to corsets and tight lacing in response to the
  demands of fashion, even though nature has so bountifully provided for
  the safety of this important organ. By constant pressure the vagina and
  womb may be compressed into one-third their natural length or crowded
  into an unnatural position. We can readily see, then, the effect of
  lacing or tight clothing. Under these circumstances the ligaments lose
  their elasticity, and as a result we have prolapsus or falling of the
  womb.</p>

  <p>22. <b>"I Am More Anxious</b> for growing girls than for any other
  earthly object. These girls are to be the mothers of future generations;
  upon them hangs the destiny of the world in coming time, and if they can
  be made to understand what is right and what is wrong with regard to
  their own bodies now, while they are young, the children they will give
  birth to and the men and women who shall call them mother will be of a
  higher type and belong to a nobler class than those of the present
  day.</p>

  <p>23. <b>"All Women Cannot</b> have good features, but they can look
  well, and it is possible to a great extent to correct deformity and
  develop much of the figure. The first step to good looks is good health,
  and the first element of health is cleanliness. Keep clean&mdash;wash
  freely, bathe regularly. All the skin wants is leave to act, and it takes
  care of itself.</p>

  <p>24. <b>"Girls Sometimes Get the Idea</b> that it is nice to be 'weak'
  and 'delicate,' but they cannot get a more false idea! God meant women to
  be strong and able-bodied, and only by being so can they be happy and
  capable of imparting happiness to others. It is only by being strong and
  healthy that they can be perfect in their sexual nature; and it is only
  by being perfect in this part of their being that you can become a noble,
  grand and beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>25. <b>"Up to the Age</b> of puberty, if the girl has grown naturally,
  waist, hips and shoulders are about the same in width, the shoulders
  being, perhaps, a trifle the broadest. Up to this time the sexual organs
  have grown but little. Now they take a sudden start and need more room.
  Nature aids the girls; the tissues and muscles increase in size and the
  pelvis bones enlarge. The limbs grow plump, the girl stops growing tall
  and becomes round and full. Unsuspected strength comes to her; tasks that
  were once hard to perform are now easy; her voice becomes sweeter and
  stronger. The mind develops more rapidly even than the body; her brain is
  more active and quicker; subjects that once were <!-- Page 388 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page388"></a>[388]</span>dull and dry have
  unwonted interest; lessons are more easily learned; the eyes sparkle with
  intelligence, indicating increased mental power; her manner denotes the
  consciousness of new power; toys of childhood are laid away; womanly
  thoughts and pursuits fill her mind; budding childhood has become
  blooming womanhood. Now, if ever, must be laid the foundation of physical
  vigor and of a healthy body. Girls should realize the significance of
  this fact. Do not get the idea that men admire a weakly, puny, delicate,
  small-waisted, languid, doll-like creature, a libel on true womanhood.
  Girls admire men with broad chests, square shoulders, erect form, keen
  bright eyes, hard muscles and undoubted vigor. Men also turn naturally to
  healthy, robust, well-developed girls, and to win their admiration girls
  must meet their ideals. A good form, a sound mind and a healthy body are
  within the reach of nine out of ten of our girls by proper care and
  training. Physical bankruptcy may claim the same proportion if care and
  training are neglected.</p>

  <p>26. <b>"A Woman Five Feet Tall</b> should measure two feet around the
  waist and thirty-three inches around the hips. A waist less than this
  proportion indicates compression either by lacing or tight clothing.
  Exercise in the open air, take long walks and vigorous exercise, using
  care not to overdo it. Housework will prove a panacea for many of the
  ills which flesh is heir to. One hour's exercise at the wash-*tub is of
  far more value, from a physical standpoint, than hours at the piano.
  Boating is most excellent exercise and within the reach of many. Care in
  dressing is also important, and, fortunately, fashion is coming to the
  rescue here. It is essential that no garments be suspended from the
  waist. Let the shoulders bear the weight of all the clothing, so that the
  organs of the body may be left free and unimpeded.</p>

  <p>27. <b>"Sleep Should be Had</b> regularly and abundantly. Avoid late
  hours, undue excitement, evil associations; partake of plain, nutritious
  food, and health will be your reward. There is one way of destroying
  health, which, fortunately, is not as common among girls as boys, and
  which must be mentioned ere this chapter closes. Self-abuse is practised
  among growing girls to such an extent as to arouse serious alarm. Many a
  girl has been led to handle and play with her sexual organs through the
  advice of some girl who has obtained temporary pleasure in that <!-- Page
  389 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page389"></a>[389]</span>way; or,
  perchance, chafing has been followed by rubbing until the organs have
  become congested with blood, and in this accidental manner the girl
  discovered what seems to her a source of pleasure, but which, alas, is a
  source of misery, and even death.</p>

  <p>28. <b>"As In the Boy, So In the Girl</b>, self-abuse causes an undue
  amount of blood to flow to those organs, thus depriving other parts of
  the body of its nourishment, the weakest part first showing the effect of
  want of sustenance. All that has been said upon this loathsome subject in
  the preceding chapter for boys might well be repeated here, but space
  forbids. Read that chapter again, and know that the same signs that
  betray the boy will make known the girl addicted to the vice. The
  bloodless lips, the dull, heavy eye surrounded with dark rings, the
  nerveless hand, the blanched cheek, the short breath, the old, faded
  look, the weakened memory and silly irritability tell the story all too
  plainly. The same evil result follows, ending perhaps in death, or worse,
  in insanity. Aside from the injury the girl does herself by yielding to
  this habit, there is one other reason which appeals to the conscience,
  and that is, self-abuse is an offence against moral law&mdash;it is
  putting to a vile, selfish use the organs which were given for a high,
  sacred purpose.</p>

  <p>29. <b>"Let Them Alone</b>, except to care for them when care is
  needed, and they may prove the greatest blessing you have ever known.
  They were given you that you might become a mother, the highest office to
  which God has ever called one of His creatures. Do not debase yourself
  and become lower than the beasts of the field. If this habit has fastened
  itself upon any one of our readers, stop it now. Do not allow yourself to
  think about it, give up all evil associations, seek pure companions, and
  go to your mother, older sister, or physician for advice.</p>

  <p>30. <b>"And You, Mother</b>, knowing the danger that besets your
  daughters at this critical period, are you justified in keeping silent?
  Can you be held guiltless if your daughter ruins body and mind because
  you were <i>too modest</i> to tell her the laws of her being? There is no
  love that is dearer to your daughter than <i>yours</i>, no advice that is
  more respected than <i>yours</i>, no one whose warning would be more
  potent. Fail not in your duty. As motherhood has been your sweetest joy,
  so help your daughter to make it hers."</p>

  <p>1. With a shy look, approaching his mother when she was alone, the boy
  of fifteen said, "There are some things I want to ask you. I hear the
  boys speak of them at school, and I don't understand, and a fellow
  doesn't like to ask any one but his mother."</p>

  <p>2. Drawing him down to her, in the darkness that was closing about
  them, the mother spoke to her son and the son to his mother freely of
  things which everybody must know sooner or later, and which no boy should
  learn from "anyone but his mother" or father.</p>

  <p>3. If you do not answer such a natural question, your boy will turn
  for answer to others, and learn things, perhaps, which your cheeks may
  well blush to have him know.</p>

  <p>4. Our boys and girls are growing faster than we think. The world
  moves; we can no longer put off our children <!-- Page 391 --><span

  tales; even MacDonald's beautiful statement,</p>

  <p>does not satisfy them when they reverse his question and ask, "Where
  did I come from?"</p>

  <p>5. They must be answered. If we put them off, they may be tempted to
  go elsewhere for information, and hear half-truths, or whole truths so
  distorted, so mingled with what is low and impure that, struggle against
  it as they may in later years, their minds will always retain these early
  impressions.</p>

  <p>6. It is not so hard if you begin early. The very flowers are object
  lessons. The wonderful mystery of life is wrapped in one flower, with its
  stamens, pistils and ovaries. Every child knows how an egg came in the
  nest, and takes it as a matter of course; why not go one step farther
  with them and teach the wonder, the beauty, the holiness that surrounds
  maternity anywhere? Why, centuries ago the Romans honored, and taught
  their boys to honor, the women in whose safety was bound up the future of
  their existence as a nation! Why should we do less?</p>

  <p>7. Your sons and mine, your daughters and mine, need to be wisely
  taught and guarded just along these lines, if your sons and mine, your
  daughters and mine, are to grow up into a pure, healthy, Christian
  manhood and womanhood.</p>

  <p>8. <a name="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>"How grand is the
  boy who has kept himself undefiled! His complexion clear, his muscles
  firm, his movements vigorous, his manner frank, his courage undaunted,
  his brain active, his will firm, his self-control perfect, his body and
  mind unfolding day by day. His life should be one song of praise and
  thanksgiving. If you want your boy to be such a one, train him, my dear
  woman, <i>to-day</i>, and his <i>to-morrow</i> will take care of
  itself.</p>

  <p>9. "Think you that good seed sown will bring forth bitter fruit? A
  thousand times, No! As we sow, so shall we reap. Train your boys in
  morality, temperance and virtue. Teach them to embrace good and shun
  evil. Teach them the true from the false; the light from the dark. Teach
  them that when they take a thing that is not their own, they commit a
  sin. Teach them that <i>sin means disobedience of God's laws of every
  kind</i>.</p>

  <p>10. "God made every organ of our body with the intention that it
  should perform a certain work. If we wish to see, we use our eyes; if we
  want to hear, our ears are called into use. In fact, nature teaches us
  the proper use of <i>all our organs</i>. I say to you, mother, and oh, so
  earnestly: 'Go teach your boy that which you may never be ashamed to do,
  about these organs that make him <i>specially a boy</i>.'</p>

  <p>11. "Teach him they are called <i>sexual organs</i>; that they are not
  impure, but of special importance, and made by God for a definite
  purpose. Teach him that there are impurities taken from the system in
  fluid form called urine, and that it passes through the sexual organs,
  but that nature takes care of that. Teach him that these organs are given
  as a sacred trust, that in maturer years he may be the means of giving
  life to those who shall live forever.</p>

  <p>12. "Impress upon him that if these organs are abused, or if they are
  put to any use besides that for which God made them&mdash;and He did not
  intend they should be used at all until man is fully grown&mdash;they
  will bring disease and ruin upon those who abuse and disobey the laws
  which God has made to govern them. If he has ever learned to handle his
  <i>sexual organs</i>, or to touch them in any way except to keep them
  clean, not to do it again. If he does he will not grow up happy, healthy
  and strong.</p>

  <p>13. "Teach him that when he handles or excites the <!-- Page 393

  all parts of the body suffer, because they are connected by nerves that
  run throughout the system; this is why it is called 'self-abuse.' The
  whole body is abused when this part of the body is handled or excited in
  any manner whatever. Teach them to shun all children who indulge in this
  loathsome habit, or all children who talk about these things. The sin is
  terrible, and is, in fact, worse than lying or stealing. For, although
  these are wicked and will ruin their souls, yet this habit of self-abuse
  will ruin both soul and body.</p>

  <p>14. "If the sexual organs are handled, it brings too much blood to
  these parts, and this produces a diseased condition; it also causes
  disease in other organs of the body, because they are left with a less
  amount of blood than they ought to have. The sexual organs, too, are very
  closely connected with the spine and the brain by means of the nerves,
  and if they are handled, or if you keep thinking about them, these nerves
  get excited and become exhausted, and this makes the back ache, the brain
  heavy and the whole body weak.</p>

  <p>15. "It lays the foundation for consumption, paralysis and heart
  disease. It weakens the memory, makes a boy careless, negligent and
  listless. It even makes many lose their minds; others, when grown, commit
  suicide. How often mothers see their little boys handling themselves, and
  let it pass, because they think the boy will outgrow the habit, and do
  not realize the strong hold it has upon them. I say to you who love your
  boys&mdash;'Watch!'</p>

  <p>16. "Don't think it does no harm to your boy because he does not
  suffer now, for the effects of this vice come on so slowly that the
  victim is often very near death before you realize that he has done
  himself harm. The boy with no knowledge of the consequences, and with no
  one to warn him, finds momentary pleasure in its practice, and so
  contracts a habit which grows upon him, undermining his health, poisoning
  his mind, arresting his development, and laying the foundation for future
  misery.</p>

  <p>17. "Do not read this book and forget it, for it contains earnest and
  living truths. Do not let false modesty stand in your way, but from this
  time on keep this thought in mind&mdash;'the saving of your boy.' Follow
  its teachings and you will bless God as long as you live. Read it to your
  neighbors, who, like yourself, have growing boys, and urge them for the
  sake of humanity to heed its advice. <!-- Page 394 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page394"></a>[394]</span></p>

  <p>18. "Right here we want to emphasize the importance of
  <i>cleanliness</i>. We verily believe that oftentimes these habits
  originate in a burning and irritating sensation about the organs, caused
  by a want of thorough washing.</p>

  <p>19. "It is worthy of note that many eminent physicians now advocate
  the custom of circumcision, claiming that the removal of a little of the
  foreskin induces cleanliness, thus preventing the irritation and
  excitement which come from the gathering of the whiteish matter under the
  foreskin at the beginning of the glands. This irritation being removed,
  the boy is less apt to tamper with his sexual organs. The argument seems
  a good one, especially when we call to mind the high physical state of
  those people who have practiced the custom.</p>

  <p>20. "Happy is the mother who can feel she has done her duty, in this
  direction, while her boy is still a child. For those mothers, though,
  whose little boys have now grown to boyhood with the evil still upon
  them, and <i>you</i>, through ignorance, permitted it, we would say,
  'Begin at once; it is never too late.' If he has not lost all will power,
  he can be saved. Let him go in confidence to a reputable physician and
  follow his advice. Simple diet, plentiful exercise in open air and
  congenial employment will do much. Do not let the mind dwell upon evil
  thoughts, shun evil companions, avoid vulgar stories, sensational novels,
  and keep the thoughts pure.</p>

  <p>21. "Let him interest himself in social and benevolent affairs,
  participate in Sunday-school work, farmers' clubs, or any organizations
  which tend to elevate and inspire noble sentiment. Let us remember that
  'a perfect man is the noblest work of God.' God has given us a life which
  is to last forever, and the little time we spend on earth is as nothing
  to the ages which we are to spend in the world beyond; so our earthly
  life is a very important part of our existence, for it is here that the
  foundation is laid for either happiness or misery in the future. It is
  here that we decide our destiny, and our efforts to know and obey God's
  laws in our bodies as well as in our souls will not only bring blessings
  to us in this life, but never-ending happiness throughout eternity."</p>

  <p>22. <b>A Question.</b>&mdash;How can a father chew and smoke tobacco,

<h2>The Inhumanities of Parents.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

      alt="He Who Loves Children." title="He Who Loves Children." /></a>
    AN OLD ADAGE: "HE WHO LOVES CHILDREN WILL DO YOU NO HARM."
  </div>
  <p>1. Not long ago a Presbyterian minister in Western New York whipped
  his three-year-old boy to death for refusing to say his prayers. The
  little fingers were broken; the tender flesh was bruised and actually
  mangled; strong men wept when they looked on the lifeless body. Think of
  a strong man from one hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds in weight,
  pouncing upon a little child, like a Tiger upon a Lamb, and with his
  strong arm inflicting physical blows on the delicate tissues of a child's
  body. See its frail and trembling flesh quiver and its tender nervous
  organization shaking with terror and fear.</p>

  <p>2. How often is this the case in the punishment of children all over
  this broad land! Death is not often the immediate consequence of this
  brutality as in the above stated case, but the punishment is often as
  unjust, and the physical constitution of children is often ruined and the
  mind by fright seriously injured.</p>

  <p>3. Everyone knows the sudden sense of pain, and sometimes dizziness
  and nausea follow, as the results of an accidental hitting of the ankle,
  knee or elbow against a hard substance, and involuntary tears are brought
  to the eyes; but what is such a pain as this compared with the pains of a
  dozen or more quick blows on the body of a little helpless child from the
  strong arm of a parent in a passion? Add to this overwhelming terror of
  fright, the strangulating effects of sighing and shrieking, and you have
  a complete picture of child-torture.</p>

  <p>4. Who has not often seen a child receive, within an hour or two of
  the first whipping, a second one, for some small ebullition of nervous
  irritability, which was simply inevitable from its spent and worn
  condition?</p>

  <p>5. Would not all mankind cry out at the inhumanity of one who, as
  things are to-day, should propose the substitution of pricking or cutting
  or burning for whipping? It would, however, be easy to show that small
  jabs or pricks or cuts are more human than the blows many children
  receive. Why may not lying be as legitimately cured by blisters made with
  hot coals as by black and blue spots made with a ruler or whip? The
  principle is the same; and if the principle is right, why not multiply
  methods?</p>

  <p>6. How many loving mothers will, without any thought of cruelty,
  inflict half a dozen quick blows on the little hand of her child, and
  when she could no more take a pin and make <!-- Page 397 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page397"></a>[397]</span>the same number of
  thrusts into the tender flesh, than she could bind the baby on a rack.
  Yet the pin-thrust would hurt far less, and would probably make a deeper
  impression on the child's mind.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs398.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/398.jpg"
      alt="Domesticity." title="Domesticity." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>7. We do not intend to be understood that a child must have everything
  that it desires and every whim and wish to receive special recognition by
  the parents. Children can soon be made to understand the necessity of
  obedience, and punishment can easily be brought about by teaching them
  self-denial. Deny them the use of a certain plaything, deny <!-- Page 398
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page398"></a>[398]</span>them the
  privilege of visiting certain of their little friends, deny them the
  privilege of the table, etc., and these self-denials can be applied
  according to the age and condition of the child, with firmness and
  without any yielding. Children will soon learn obedience if they see the
  parents are sincere. Lessons of home government can be learned by the
  children at home as well as they can learn lessons at school.</p>

  <p>8. The trouble is, many parents need more government, more training
  and more discipline than the little ones under their control.</p>

  <p>9. Scores of times during the day a child is told in a short,
  authoritative way to do or not to do certain little things, which we ask
  at the hands of elder persons as favors. When we speak to an elder
  person, we say, would you be so kind as to close the door, when the same
  person making the request of a child will say, "<i>Shut the door.</i>"
  "<i>Bring me the chair.</i>" "<i>Stop that noise.</i>" "<i>Sit down
  there.</i>" Whereas, if the same kindness was used towards the child it
  would soon learn to imitate the example.</p>

  <p>10. On the other hand, let a child ask for anything without saying
  "please," receive anything without saying "thank you," it suffers a
  rebuke and a look of scorn at once. Often a child insists on having a
  book, chair or apple to the inconveniencing of an elder, and what an
  outcry is raised: "Such rudeness;" "Such an ill-mannered child;" "His
  parents must have neglected him strangely." Not at all: The parents may
  have been steadily telling him a great many times every day not to do
  these precise things which you dislike. But they themselves have been all
  the time doing those very things before him, and there is no proverb that
  strikes a truer balance between two things than the old one which weighs
  example over against precept.</p>

  <p>11. It is a bad policy to be rude to children. A child will win and be
  won, and in a long run the chances are that the child will have better
  manners than its parents. Give them a good example and take pains in
  teaching them lessons of obedience and propriety, and there will be
  little difficulty in raising a family of beautiful and well-behaved
  children.</p>

  <p>12. Never correct a child in the presence of others; it is a rudeness
  to the child that will soon destroy its self-respect. It is the way
  criminals are made and should always and everywhere be condemned.</p>

  <p>13. But there are no words to say what we are or what we deserve, if
  we do this to the little children whom we <!-- Page 399 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page399"></a>[399]</span>have dared for our own
  pleasure to bring into the perils of this life, and whose whole future
  may be blighted by the mistakes of our careless hands. There are
  thousands of young men and women to-day groaning under the penalties and
  burdens of life, who owe their misfortunes, their shipwreck and ruin to
  the ignorance or indifference of parents.</p>

  <p>14. Parents of course love their children, but with that love there is
  a responsibility that cannot be shirked. The government and training of
  children is a study that demands a parent's time and attention often much
  more than the claims of business.</p>

  <p>15. Parents, study the problems that come up every day in your home.
  Remember, your future happiness, and the future welfare of your children,
  depend upon it.</p>

  <p>16. <b>Criminals and Heredity.</b>&mdash;Wm. M. F. Round was for many
  years in charge of the House of Refuge on Randall's Island, New York, and
  his opportunities for observation in the work among criminals surely make
  him a competent judge, and he says in his letter to the New York
  Observer: "Among this large number of young offenders I can state with
  entire confidence that not one per cent. were children born of criminal
  parents; and with equal confidence I am able to say that the common cause
  of their delinquency was found in bad parental training, in bad
  companionship, and in lack of wholesome restraint from evil associations
  and influences. It was this knowledge that led to the establishing of the
  House of Refuge nearly three-quarters of a century ago."</p>

  <p>17. <b>Bad Training.</b>&mdash;Thus it is seen from one of the best
  authorities in the United States that criminals are made either by the
  indifference or the neglect of parents, or both, or by too much training
  without proper judgment and knowledge. Give your children a good example,
  and never tell a child to do something and then become indifferent as to
  whether they do it or not. A child should never be told twice to do the
  same thing. Teach the child in childhood obedience and never vary from
  that rule. Do it kindly but firmly.</p>

  <p>18. <b>If Your Children Do Not Obey or Respect You</b> in their
  childhood and youth, how can you expect to govern them when older and
  shape their character for future usefulness and good citizenship?</p>

  <p>19. <b>The Fundamental Rule.</b>&mdash;Never tell a child twice to do
  the same thing. Command the respect of your children, and there will be
  no question as to obedience.</p>

<h2>Chastity and Purity of Character.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Chastity</b> is the purest and brightest jewel in human
  character. Dr. Pierce in his widely known <i>Medical Adviser</i> says:
  For the full and perfect development of mankind, both mental and
  physical, chastity is necessary. The health demands abstinence from
  unlawful intercourse. Therefore children should be instructed to avoid
  all impure works of fiction, which tend to inflame the mind and excite
  the passions. Only in total abstinence from illicit pleasures is there
  safety, morals, and health, while integrity, peace and happiness are the
  conscious rewards of virtue. Impurity travels downward with intemperance,
  obscenity and corrupting diseases, to degradation and death. A dissolute,
  licentious, free-and-easy life is filled with the dregs of human
  suffering, iniquity and despair. The penalties which follow a violation
  of the law of chastity are found to be severe and swiftly
  retributive.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs401.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/401.jpg"
      alt="Playing Tennis." title="Playing Tennis." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>2. <b>The Union</b> of the sexes in holy Matrimony is a law of nature,
  finding sanction in both morals and legislation. Even some of the lower
  animals unite in this union for life and instinctively observe the law of
  conjugal fidelity with a consistency which might put to blush other
  animals more highly endowed. It seems important to discuss this subject
  and understand our social evils, as well as the intense passional desires
  of the sexes, which must be controlled, or they lead to ruin.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Sexual Propensities</b> are possessed by all, and these must be
  held in abeyance, until they are needed for legitimate purposes. Hence
  parents ought to understand the value to their children of mental and
  physical labor, to elevate and strengthen the intellectual and moral
  faculties, to develop the muscular system and direct the energies of the
  blood into healthful channels. Vigorous employment of mind and body
  engrosses the vital energies and diverts them from undue excitement of
  the sexual desires.</p>

  <p><i>Give your young people plenty of outdoor amusement; less of dancing
  and more of croquet and lawn tennis. Stimulate the methods of pure
  thoughts in innocent amusement, and your sons and daughters will mature
  to manhood and womanhood pure and chaste in character.</i> <!-- Page 401
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page401"></a>[401]</span></p>

  <p>4. <b>Ignorance Does Not Mean Innocence.</b>&mdash;It is a current
  idea, especially among our good common people, that the child should be
  kept in ignorance regarding the mystery of his own body and how he was
  created or came into the world. This is a great mistake. Parents must
  know that the sources of social impurity are great, and the child is a
  hundred times more liable to have his young mind poisoned if entirely
  ignorant of the functions of his nature than if judiciously enlightened
  on these important truths by the parent. The parent must give him weapons
  of defense against the putrid corruption he is sure to meet outside the
  parental roof. The child cannot get through the A, B, C period of school
  without it.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Conflicting Views.</b>&mdash;There is a great difference of
  opinion regarding the age at which the child should be taught the
  mysteries of nature: some maintain that he cannot comprehend the subject
  before the age of puberty; others say "they will find it out soon enough,
  it is not best to have them over-wise while they are so young. Wait a
  while." That is just the point (<i>they will find it out</i>), and we ask
  in all candor, is it not better that they learn it from the pure loving
  mother, untarnished from any insinuating remark, than that they should
  learn it from some foul-mouthed libertine on the street, or some giddy
  girl at school? Mothers! fathers! which think you is the most sensible
  and fraught with the least danger to your darling boy or girl?</p>

  <p>6. <b>Delay is Fraught With Danger.</b>&mdash;Knowledge on a subject
  so vitally connected with moral health must not be deferred. It is safe
  to say that no child, no boy at least in these days of excitement and
  unrest, reaches the age of ten years without getting some idea of
  nature's laws regarding parenthood. And ninety-nine chances to one, those
  ideas will be vile and pernicious unless they come from a wise, loving
  and pure parent. Now, we entreat you, parents, mothers! do not wait;
  begin before a false notion has had chance to find lodgment in the
  childish mind. But remember this is a lesson of life, it cannot be told
  in one chapter; it is as important as the lessons of love and duty.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The First Lessons.</b>&mdash;Should you be asked by your four or
  five-year old, "Mamma, where did you get me?" Instead of saying, "The
  doctor brought you," or "God made you and a stork brought you from
  Babyland on his back," tell him the truth as you would about any ordinary
  question. One mother's explanation was something like this: "My dear, you
  were not made any more than apples are made, or the little chickens are
  made. Your dolly was <!-- Page 402 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page402"></a>[402]</span>made, but it has no life like you have.
  God has provided that all living things such as plants, trees, little
  chickens, little kittens, little babies, etc., should grow from seeds or
  little tiny eggs. Apples grow, little chickens grow, little babies grow.
  Apple and peach trees grow from seeds that are planted in the ground, and
  the apples and peaches grow on the trees. Baby chickens grow inside the
  eggs that are kept warm by the mother hen for a certain time. Baby boys
  and girls do not grow inside an egg, but they start to grow inside of a
  snug warm nest, from an egg that is so small you cannot see it with just
  your eye." This was not given at once, but from time to time as the child
  asked questions and in the simplest language, with many illustrations
  from plant and animal life. It may have occupied months, but in time the
  lesson was fully understood.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Second Lesson.</b>&mdash;The second lesson came with the
  question, "But <i>where</i> is the nest?" The ice is now broken, as it
  were; it was an easy matter for the mother to say, "The nest in which you
  grew, dear, was close to your mother's heart inside her body. All things
  that do not grow inside the egg itself, and which are kept warm by the
  mother's body, begin to grow from the egg in a nest inside the mother's
  body." It may be that this mother had access to illustrations of the babe
  in the womb which were shown and explained to the child, a boy. He was
  pleased and satisfied with the explanations. It meant nothing out of the
  ordinary any more than a primary lesson on the circulatory system did, it
  was knowledge on nature in its purity and simplicity taught by mother,
  and hence caused no surprise. The subject of the male and female
  generative organs came later; the greatest pains and care was taken to
  make it clear, the little boy was taught that the <i>sexual organs</i>
  were made for a high and holy purpose, that their office at present is
  only to carry off impurities from the system in the fluid form called
  urine, and that he must never handle his <i>sexual organs</i> nor touch
  them in any way except to keep them clean, and if he does this, he will
  grow up a bright, happy and healthy boy. But if he excites or
  <i>abuses</i> them, he will become puny, sickly and unhappy. All this was
  explained in language pure and simple. There is now in the boy a sturdy
  base of character building along the line of virtue and purity through
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Silly Dirty Trash.</b>&mdash;But I hear some mother say "Such
  silly dirty trash to tell a child!" It is not dirty nor silly; it is
  nature's untarnished truth. God has ordained that children should thus be
  brought into the world, do you call the works of God silly? Remember,
  kind mother, and <!-- Page 403 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page403"></a>[403]</span>don't forget it, if you fail to teach your
  children, boys or girls, these important lessons early in life, they will
  learn them from other sources, perhaps long ere you dream of it, and
  ninety-nine times out of one hundred they will get improper, perverted,
  impure and vile ideas of these important truths; besides you have lost
  their confidence and you will never regain it in these matters. They will
  never come to mamma for information on these subjects. And, think you,
  that your son and daughter, later in life will make you their confidant
  as they ought? Will your beautiful daughter hand the first letters she
  receives from her lover to mamma to read, and seek her counsel and advice
  when she replies to them? Will she ask mamma whether it is ever proper to
  sit in her lover's lap? I think not; you have blighted her confidence and
  alienated her affections. You have kept knowledge from her that she had a
  right to know; you even failed to teach her the important truths of
  menstruation. Troubled and excited at the first menstrual flow, she
  dashed her feet in cold water hoping to stop the flow. You know the
  results&mdash;she is now twenty-five but is suffering from it to this
  day. You, her mother, over fastidious, <i>so very nice</i> you would
  never mention "<i>such silly trash</i>," but by your consummate
  foolishness and mock modesty you have ruined your daughter's health, and
  though in later years she may forgive you, yet she can never love and
  respect you as she ought.</p>

  <p>10. <b>"Knowledge the Preserver of Purity."</b>&mdash;Laura E.
  Scammon, writing on this subject, in the <i>Arena</i> of November, 1893,
  says: "When questions arise that can not be answered by observation,
  reply to each as simply and directly as you answer questions upon other
  subjects, giving scientific names and facts, and such explanations as are
  suited to the comprehension of the child. Treat nature and her laws
  always with serious, respectful attention. Treat the holy mysteries of
  parenthood reverently, never losing sight of the great law upon which are
  founded all others&mdash;the law of love. Say it and sing it, play it and
  pray it into the soul of your child, that <i>love is lord of
  all</i>."</p>

  <p>11. <b>Conclusion of the Whole Matter.</b>&mdash;Observation and
  common sense should teach every parent that lack of knowledge on these
  subjects and proper counsel and advice in later years is the main cause
  of so many charming girls being seduced and led astray, and so many
  bright promising boys wrecked by <i>self-abuse</i> or <i>social
  impurity</i>. Make your children your confidants early in life,
  especially in these things, have frequent talks with them on nature, and
  you will never, other things being equal, mourn over a ruined daughter or
  a wreckless, debased son.</p>

<h2>Exciting the Passions in Children.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Conversation before Children.</b>&mdash;The conduct and
  conversation of adults before children and youth, how often have I
  blushed with shame, and kindled with indignation at the conversation of
  parents, and especially of mothers, to their children: "John, go and kiss
  Harriet, for she is your sweet-heart." Well may shame make him hesitate
  and hang his head. "Why, John, I did not think you so great a coward.
  Afraid of the girls, are you? That will never do. Come, go along, and hug
  and kiss her. There, that's a man. I guess you will love the girls yet."
  Continually is he teased about the girls and being in love, till he
  really selects a sweet-heart.</p>

  <p>2. <b>The Loss of Maiden Purity and Natural Delicacy.</b>&mdash;I will
  not lift the veil, nor expose the conduct of children among themselves.
  And all this because adults have filled their heads with those impurities
  which surfeit their own. What could more effectually wear off that
  natural delicacy, that maiden purity and bashfulness, which form the main
  barriers against the influx of vitiated Amativeness? How often do those
  whose modesty has been worn smooth, even take pleasure in thus saying and
  doing things to raise the blush on the cheek of youth and innocence,
  merely to witness the effect of this improper illusion upon them; little
  realizing that they are thereby breaking down the barriers of their
  virtue, and prematurely kindling the fires of animal passion!</p>

  <p>3. <b>Balls, Parties and Amusements.</b>&mdash;The entire machinery of
  balls and parties, of dances and other amusements of young people, tend
  to excite and inflame this passion. Thinking it a fine thing to get in
  love, they court and form attachments long before either their mental or
  physical powers are matured. Of course, these young loves, these
  green-house exotics, must be broken off, and their miserable subjects
  left burning up with the fierce fires of a flaming passion, which, if
  left alone, would have slumbered on for years, till they were prepared
  for its proper management and exercise.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Sowing the Seeds for Future Ruin.</b>&mdash;Nor is it merely the
  conversation of adults that does all this mischief; their manners also
  increase it. Young men take the hands of girls from six to thirteen years
  old, kiss them, press them, and play with them so as, in a great variety
  of ways, to excite their innocent passions, combined, I grant, with
  friendship and refinement&mdash;for all this is genteely done. They <!--
  Page 405 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page405"></a>[405]</span>intend no harm, and parents dream of none:
  and yet their embryo love is awakened, to be again still more easily
  excited. Maiden ladies, and even married women, often express similar
  feelings towards lads, not perhaps positively improper in themselves, yet
  injurious in their ultimate effects.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Reading Novels.</b>&mdash;How often have I seen girls not twelve
  years old, as hungry for a story or novel as they should be for their
  dinners! A sickly sentimentalism is thus formed, and their minds are
  sullied with impure desires. Every fashionable young lady must of course
  read every new novel, though nearly all of them contain exceptionable
  allusions, perhaps delicately covered over with a thin gauze of
  fashionable refinement; yet, on that very account, the more
  objectionable. If this work contained one improper allusion to their ten,
  many of those fastidious ladies who now eagerly devour the vulgarities of
  Dumas, and the double-entendres of Bulwer, and even converse with
  gentlemen about their contents, would discountenance or condemn it as
  improper. <i>Shame on novel-reading women</i>; for they cannot have pure
  minds or unsullied feelings but Cupid and the beaux, and waking of dreams
  of love, are fast consuming their health and virtue.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Theater-going.</b>&mdash;Theaters and theatrical dancing, also
  inflame the passions, and are "the wide gate" of "the broad road" of
  moral impurity. Fashionable music is another, especially the verses set
  to it, being mostly love-sick ditties, or sentimental odes, breathing
  this tender passion in its most melting and bewitching strains. Improper
  prints often do immense injury in this respect, as do also balls,
  parties, annuals, newspaper articles, exceptional works, etc.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Conclusion of the Whole Matter.</b>&mdash;Stop for one
  moment and think for yourself and you will be convinced that the
  sentiment herein announced is for your good and the benefit of all
  mankind.</p>

<h2>Puberty, Virility and Hygienic Laws.</h2>

  </div>
  <p>1. <b>What is Puberty?</b>&mdash;The definition is explained in
  another portion of this book, but it should be understood that it is not
  a prompt or immediate change; it is a slow extending growth and may
  extend for many years. The ripening of physical powers do not take place
  when the first signs of puberty appear.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Proper Age.</b>&mdash;The proper age for puberty should vary
  from twelve to eighteen years. As a general rule, in the more vigorous
  and the more addicted to athletic exercise or out-door life, this change
  is slower in making its approach.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Hygienic Attention.</b>&mdash;Youths at this period should
  receive special private attention. They should be taught the purpose of
  the sexual organs and the proper hygienic laws that govern them, and they
  should also be taught to rise in the morning and not to lie in bed after
  waking up, because it is largely owing to this habit that the secret vice
  is contracted. One of the common causes of premature excitement in many
  boys is a tight foreskin. It may cause much evil and ought always to be
  remedied. Ill-fitting garments often cause much irritation in children
  and produce unnatural passions. It is best to have boys sleep in separate
  beds and not have them sleep together if it can be avoided. <!-- Page 407
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page407"></a>[407]</span></p>

  <p>4. <b>Proper Influence.</b>&mdash;Every boy and girl should be
  carefully trained to look with disgust on everything that is indecent in
  word or action. Let them be taught a sense of shame in doing shameful
  things, and teach them that modesty is honorable, and that immodesty is
  indecent and dishonorable. Careful training at the proper age may save
  many a boy or girl from ruin.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Sexual Passions.</b>&mdash;The sexual passions may be a fire
  from heaven, or a subtle flame from hell. It depends upon the government
  and proper control. The noblest and most unselfish emotions take their
  arise in the passion of sex. Its sweet influence, its elevating ties, its
  vibrations and harmony, all combine to make up the noble and courageous
  traits of man.</p>

  <p>6. <b>When Passions Begin.</b>&mdash;It is thought by some that
  passions begin at the age of puberty, but the passions may be produced as
  early as five or ten years. All depends upon the training or the want of
  it. Self-abuse is not an uncommon evil at the age of eight or ten. A
  company of bad boys often teach an innocent child that which will develop
  his ruin. A boy may feel a sense of pleasure at eight and produce a
  slight discharge, but not of semen. Thus it is seen that parents may by
  neglect do their child the greatest injury.</p>

  <p>7. <b>False Modesty.</b>&mdash;Let there be no false modesty on part
  of the parents. Give the child the necessary advice and instructions as
  soon as necessary.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Man Unsexed</b>, by Mutilation or Masturbation. Eunuchs are
  proverbial for their cruelty and crafty and unsympathizing dispositions.
  Their mental powers are feeble and their physical strength is inferior.
  They lack courage and physical endurance. When a child is operated upon
  before the age of puberty, the voice retains its childish treble, the
  limbs their soft and rounded outlines, and the neck acquires a feminine
  fulness; no beard makes its appearance. In ancient times and up to this
  time in Oriental nations eunuchs are found. They are generally slaves who
  have suffered mutilation at a tender age. It is a scientific fact that
  where boys have been taught the practice of masturbation in their early
  years, say from eight to fourteen years of age, if they survive at all
  they often have their powers reduced to a similar condition of a eunuch.
  They generally however suffer a greater disadvantage. Their health will
  be more or less injured. In the eunuch the power of sexual intercourse is
  not entirely lost but of course there is sterility and little if any
  satisfaction, and the same thing may be true of the victim of self-abuse.
  <!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page408"></a>[408]</span></p>

  <p>9. <b>Signs of Virility.</b>&mdash;As the young man develops in
  strength and years the sexual appetite will manifest itself. The
  secretion of the male known as the seed or semen depends for the
  life-transmitting power upon little minute bodies called spermatozoa.
  These are very active and numerous in a healthy secretion, being many
  hundreds in a single drop and a single one of them is capable to bring
  about conception in a female. Dr. Napheys in his "Transmission of Life,"
  says: "The secreted fluid has been frozen and kept at a temperature of
  zero for four days, yet when it was thawed these animalcules, as they are
  supposed to be, were as active as ever. They are not, however, always
  present, and when present may be of variable activity. In young men, just
  past puberty, and in aged men, they are often scarce and languid in
  motion." At the proper age the secretion is supposed to be the most
  active, generally at the age of twenty-five, and decreases as age
  increases.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Hygienic Rule.</b>&mdash;The man at mid-life should guard
  carefully his passions and the husband his virile powers, and as the
  years progress, steadily wean himself more from his desire, for his
  passions will become weaker with age and any excitement in middle life
  may soon debilitate and destroy his virile powers.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Follies of Youth.</b>&mdash;Dr. Napheys says: "Not many men can
  fritter away a decade or two of years in dissipation and excess, and ever
  hope to make up their losses by rigid surveillance in later years." "The
  sins of youth are expiated in age," is a proverb which daily examples
  illustrate. In proportion as puberty is precocious, will decadence be
  premature; the excesses of middle life draw heavily on the fortune of
  later years. "The mill of the gods grinds slow, but it grinds exceedingly
  fine," and though nature may be a tardy creditor, she is found at last to
  be an inexorable one.</p>

<h2>Our Secret Sins.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Passions.</b>&mdash;Every healthful man has sexual desires, and
  he might as well refuse to satisfy his hunger as to deny their existence.
  The Creator has given us various appetites, intended they should be
  indulged, and has provided the means.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Reason.</b>&mdash;While it is true that a healthy man has
  strongly developed sexual passions, yet, God has crowned man with reason,
  and with a proper exercise of this wonderful faculty of the human mind no
  lascivious thoughts need to control the passions. A pure heart will
  develop pure thoughts and bring out a good life.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Rioting in Visions.</b>&mdash;Dr. Lewis says: "Rioting in
  visions of nude women may exhaust one as much as an excess in actual
  intercourse. There are multitudes who would never spend the night with an
  abandoned female, but who rarely meet a young girl that their
  imaginations are not busy with her person. This species of indulgence is
  well-nigh universal; and it is the source of all other forms&mdash;the
  fountain from which the external vices spring, and the nursery of
  masturbation."</p>

  <p>4. <b>Committing Adultery in the Heart.</b>&mdash;A young man who
  allows his mind to dwell upon the vision of nude women will soon become a
  victim of ruinous passion, and either fall under the influence of lewd
  women or resort to self-abuse. The man who has no control over his mind
  and allows impure thoughts to be associated with the name of every female
  that may be suggested to his mind, is but committing adultery in his
  heart, just as guilty at heart as though he had committed the deed.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Unchastity.</b>&mdash;So far as the record is preserved,
  unchastity has contributed above all other causes, more to the ruin and
  exhaustion and demoralization of the race than all other wickedness. And
  we shall not be likely to vanquish the monster, even in ourselves, unless
  we make the thoughts our point of attack. So long as they are sensual we
  are indulging in sexual abuse, and are almost sure, when temptation is
  presented, to commit the overt acts of sin. If we cannot succeed within,
  we may pray in vain for help to resist the tempter outwardly. A young man
  who will indulge in obscene language will be guilty of a worse deed if
  opportunity is offered.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Bad Dressing.</b>&mdash;If women knew how much mischief they do
  men they would change some of their habits of <!-- Page 410 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page410"></a>[410]</span>dress. The dress of
  their busts, the padding in different parts, are so contrived as to call
  away attention from the soul and fix it on the bosom and hips. And then,
  many, even educated women, are careful to avoid serious subjects in our
  presence&mdash;one minute before a gentleman enters the room they may be
  engaged in thoughtful discussion, but the moment he appears their whole
  style changes; they assume light fascinating ways, laugh sweet little
  bits of laughs, and turn their heads this way and that, all which forbids
  serious thinking and gives men over to imagination.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Lustful Eye.</b>&mdash;How many men there are who
  lecherously stare at every woman in whose presence they happen to be.
  These monsters stare at women as though they were naked in a cage on
  exhibition. A man whose whole manner is full of animal passion is not
  worthy of the respect of refined women. They have no thoughts, no ideas,
  no sentiments, nothing to interest them but the bodies of women whom they
  behold. The moral character of young women has no significance or weight
  in their eyes. This kind of men are a curse to society and a danger to
  the community. No young lady is safe in their company.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Rebuking Sensualism.</b>&mdash;If the young women would exercise
  an honorable independence and heap contempt upon the young men that allow
  their imagination to take such liberties, a different state of things
  would soon follow. Men of that type of character should have no
  recognition in the presence of ladies.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Early Marriages.</b>&mdash;There can be no doubt that early
  marriages are bad for both parties. For children of such a marriage
  always lack vitality. The ancient Germans did not marry until the
  twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth year, previous to which they observed the
  most rigid chastity, and in consequence they acquired a size and strength
  that excited the astonishment of Europe. The present incomparable vigor
  of that race, both physically and mentally, is due in a great measure to
  their long established aversion to marrying young. The results of too
  early marriages are in brief, stunted growth and impaired strength on the
  part of the male; delicate if not utterly bad health in the female; the
  premature old age or death of one or both, and a puny, sickly
  offspring.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Signs of Excesses.</b>&mdash;Dr. Dio Lewis says: "Some of the
  most common effects of sexual excess are backache, lassitude, giddiness,
  dimness of sight, noises in the ears, numbness of the fingers, and
  paralysis. The drain is universal, but the more sensitive organs and
  tissues suffer <!-- Page 411 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page411"></a>[411]</span>most. So the nervous system gives way and
  continues the principal sufferer throughout. A large part of the
  premature loss of sight and hearing, dizziness, numbness and pricking in
  the hands and feet, and other kindred developments, are justly chargeable
  to unbridled venery. Not unfrequently you see men whose head or back or
  nerve testifies of such reckless expenditure."</p>

  <p>11. <b>Non-Completed Intercourse.</b>&mdash;Withdrawal before the
  emission occurs is injurious to both parties. The soiling of the conjugal
  bed by the shameful man&oelig;uvres is to be deplored.</p>

  <p>12. <b>The Extent of the Practice.</b>&mdash;One cannot tell to what
  extent this vice is practiced, except by observing its consequences, even
  among people who fear to commit the slightest sin, to such a degree is
  the public conscience perverted upon this point. Still, many husbands
  know that nature often renders nugatory the most subtle calculations, and
  reconquers the rights which they have striven to frustrate. No matter;
  they persevere none the less, and by the force of habit they poison the
  most blissful moments of life, with no surety of averting the result that
  they fear. So who knows if the too often feeble and weakened infants are
  not the fruit of these in themselves incomplete procreations, and
  disturbed by preoccupations foreign to the natural act.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Health of Women.</b>&mdash;Furthermore, the moral relations
  existing between the married couple undergo unfortunate changes; this
  affection, founded upon reciprocal esteem, is little by little effaced by
  the repetition of an act which pollutes the marriage bed. If the good
  harmony of families and the reciprocal relations are seriously menaced by
  the invasion of these detestable practices, the health of women, as we
  have already intimated, is fearfully injured.</p>

  <p>14. <b>The Practice of Abortion.</b>&mdash;Then we have the practice
  of abortion reduced in modern times to a science, and almost to a
  distinct profession. A large part of the business is carried on by the
  means of medicines advertised in obscure but intelligible terms as
  embryo-destroyers or preventives of conception. Every large city has its
  professional abortionist. Many ordinary physicians destroy embryos to
  order, and the skill to do this terrible deed has even descended among
  the common people.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Sexual Exhaustion.</b>&mdash;Every sexual excitement is
  exhaustive in proportion to its intensity and continuance. If a man sits
  by the side of a woman, fondles and kisses her three or four hours, and
  allows his imagination to run riot with sexual visions, he will be five
  times as much exhausted <!-- Page 412 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page412"></a>[412]</span>as he would by the act culminating in
  emission. It is the sexual excitement more than the emission which
  exhausts. As shown in another part of this work, thoughts of sexual
  intimacies, long continued, lead to the worst effects. To a man, whose
  imagination is filled with erotic fancies the emission comes as a
  merciful interruption to the burning, harassing and wearing excitement
  which so constantly goads him.</p>

  <p>16. <b>The Desire of Good.</b>&mdash;The desire of good for its own
  sake&mdash;this is Love. The desire of good for bodily
  pleasure&mdash;this is Lust. Man is a moral being, and as such should
  always act in the animal sphere according to the spiritual law. Hence, to
  break the law of the highest creative action for the mere gratification
  of animal instinct is to perform the act of sin and to produce the
  corruption of nature.</p>

  <p>17. <b>Cause Of Prostitution.</b>&mdash;Dr. Dio Lewis says:
  "Occasionally we meet a diseased female with excessive animal passion,
  but such a case is very rare. The average woman has so little sexual
  desire that if licentiousness depended upon her, uninfluenced by her
  desire to please man or secure his support, there would be very little
  sexual excess. Man is strong&mdash;he has all the money and all the
  facilities for business and pleasure; and woman is not long in learning
  the road to his favor. Many prostitutes who take no pleasure in their
  unclean intimacies not only endure a disgusting life for the favor and
  means thus gained, but affect intense passion in their sexual contacts
  because they have learned that such exhibitions gratify men."</p>

  <p>18. <b>Husband's Brutality.</b>&mdash;Husbands! It is your
  licentiousness that drives your wives to a deed so abhorrent to their
  every wifely, womanly and maternal instinct&mdash;a deed which ruins the
  health of their bodies, prostitutes their souls, and makes marriage,
  maternity and womanhood itself degrading and loathsome. No terms can
  sufficiently characterize the cruelty, meanness and disgusting
  selfishness of your conduct when you impose on them a maternity so
  detested as to drive them to the desperation of killing their unborn
  children and often themselves.</p>

  <p>19. <b>What Drunkards Bequeath to Their Offspring.</b>&mdash;Organic
  imperfections unfit the brain for sane action, and habit confirms the
  insane condition; the man's brain has become unsound. Then comes in the
  law of hereditary descent, by which the brain of a man's children is
  fashioned after his own&mdash;not as it was originally, but as it has
  become, in consequence of frequent functional disturbance. Hence, of all
  appetites, the inherited appetite for drunkenness is <!-- Page 413
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page413"></a>[413]</span>the most
  direful. Natural laws contemplate no exceptions, and sins against them
  are never pardoned.</p>

  <p>20. <b>The Reports of Hospitals.</b>&mdash;The reports of hospitals
  for lunatics almost universally assign intemperance as one of the causes
  which predispose a man's offspring to insanity. This is even more
  strikingly manifested in the case of congenital idiocy. They come
  generally from a class of families which seem to have degenerated
  physically to a low degree. They are puny and sickly.</p>

  <p>21. <b>Secret Diseases.</b>&mdash;See the weakly, sickly and diseased
  children who are born only to suffer and die, all because of the private
  disease of the father before his marriage. Oh, let the truth be told that
  the young men of our land may learn the lessons of purity of life. Let
  them learn that in morality there is perfect protection and
  happiness.</p>

  <p>1. <b>Moral Principle.</b>&mdash;"Edgar Allen Poe, Lord Byron, and
  Robert Burns," says Dr. Geo. F. Hall, "were men of marvelous strength
  intellectually. But measured by the true rule of high moral principle,
  they were very weak. Superior endowment in a single
  direction&mdash;physical, mental, or spiritual&mdash;is not of itself
  sufficient to make one strong in all that that heroic word means.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Insane Asylum.</b>&mdash;Many a good man spiritually has gone to
  an untimely grave because of impaired physical powers. Many a good man
  spiritually has gone to the insane asylum because of bodily and mental
  weaknesses. Many a good man spiritually has fallen from virtue in an evil
  moment because of a weakened will, or, a too demanding fleshly passion,
  or, worse than either, too lax views on the subject of personal
  chastity."</p>

  <p>3. <b>Boys Learning Vices.</b>&mdash;Some ignorant and timid people
  argue that boys and young men in reading a work of this character will
  learn vices concerning which they had <!-- Page 415 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page415"></a>[415]</span>never so much as
  dreamed of before. This is, however, certain, that vices cannot be
  condemned unless they are mentioned; and if the condemnation is strong
  enough it surely will be a source of strength and of security. If light
  and education, on these important subjects, does injury, then all
  knowledge likewise must do more wrong than good. Knowledge is power, and
  the only hope of the race is enlightenment on all subjects pertaining to
  their being.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Moral Manhood.</b>&mdash;It is clearly visible that the American
  manhood is rotting down&mdash;decaying at the center. The present
  generation shows many men of a small body and weak principles, and men
  and women of this kind are becoming more and more prevalent. Dissipation
  and indiscretions of all kind are working ruin. Purity of life and
  temperate habits are being too generally disregarded.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Young Women.</b>&mdash;The vast majority of graduates from the
  schools and colleges of our land to-day, and two-thirds of the membership
  of our churches, and three-fourths of the charitable workers, are
  females. Everywhere girls are carrying off most of the prizes in
  competitive examinations, because women, as a sex, naturally maintain a
  better character, take better care of their bodies, and are less addicted
  to bad and injurious habits. While all this is true in reference to
  females, you will find that the male sex furnishes almost the entire
  number of criminals. The saloons, gambling dens, the brothels, and bad
  literature are drawing down all that the public schools can build up.
  Seventy per cent. of the young men of this land do not darken the church
  door. They are not interested in moral improvement or moral education.
  Eighty-five per cent. leave school under 15 years of age; prefer the
  loafer's honors to the benefit of school.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Promotion.</b>&mdash;The world is full of good places for good
  young men, and all the positions of trust now occupied by the present
  generation will soon be filled by the competent young men of the coming
  generation; and he that keeps his record clean, lives a pure life, and
  avoids excesses or dissipations of all kinds, and fortifies his life with
  good habits, is the young man who will be heard from, and a thousand
  places will be open for his services.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Personal Purity.</b>&mdash;Dr. George F. Hall says: "Why not pay
  careful attention to man in all his elements of strength, physical,
  mental, and moral? Why not make personal purity a fixed principle in the
  manhood of the present and coming generations, and thus insure the best
  men the world has ever seen? It can be done. Let every reader of these
  lines resolve that he will be one to help do it."</p>

  <p>1. <b>The Policy of Silence.</b>&mdash;There is no greater delusion
  than to suppose that vast number of boys know nothing about practices of
  sin. Some parents are afraid that unclean thoughts may be suggested by
  these very defences. The danger is slight. Such cases are barely
  possible, but when the untold thousands are thought of on the other side,
  who have been demoralized from childhood through ignorance, and who are
  to-day suffering the result of these vicious practices, the policy of
  silence stands condemned, and intelligent knowledge abundantly justified.
  The emphatic words of Scripture are true in this respect also, "The
  people are destroyed for lack of knowledge."</p>

  <p>2. <b>Living Illustrations.</b>&mdash;Without fear of truthful
  contradiction we affirm that the homes, public assemblies, and streets of
  all our large cities abound to-day with living illustrations and proofs
  of the widespread existence of this physical and moral scourge. An
  enervated and stunted manhood, a badly developed physique, a marked
  absence of manly and womanly strength and beauty, are painfully common
  everywhere. Boys and girls, young men and women, exist by thousands, of
  whom it may be said, they were badly born and ill-developed. Many of
  these are, to some extent, bearing the penalty of the sins and excesses
  of their parents, especially their fathers, whilst the great majority are
  reaping the fruits of their own immorality in a dwarfed and ill-formed
  body, and effeminate appearance, weak and enervated mind. <!-- Page 417
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page417"></a>[417]</span></p>

  <p>3. <b>Effeminate and Sickly Young Men.</b>&mdash;The purposeless and
  aimless life of any number of effeminate and sickly young men, is to be
  distinctly attributed to these sins. The large class of mentally impotent
  "ne'er-do-wells" are being constantly recruited and added to by those who
  practice what the celebrated Erichson calls "that hideous sin engendered
  by vice, and practiced in solitude"&mdash;the sin, be it observed, which
  is the common cause of physical and mental weakness, and of the fearfully
  impoverishing night-emissions, or as they are commonly called,
  "wet-dreams."</p>

  <p>4. <b>Weakness, Disease, Deformity, and Death.</b>&mdash;Through
  self-pollution and fornication the land is being corrupted with weakness,
  disease, deformity, and death. We regret to say that we cannot speak with
  confidence concerning the moral character of the Jew; but we have people
  amongst us who have deservedly a high character for the tone of their
  moral life&mdash;we refer to the members of the Society of Friends. The
  average of life amongst these reaches no less than fifty-six years; and,
  whilst some allowance must be made for the fact that amongst the Friends
  the poor have not a large representation, these figures show conclusively
  the soundness of this position,</p>

  <p>5. <b>Sowing Their Wild Oats.</b>&mdash;It is monstrous to suppose
  that healthy children should die just as they are coming to manhood. The
  fact that thousands of young people do reach the age of sixteen or
  eighteen, and then decline and die, should arouse parents to ask the
  question: Why? Certainly it would not be difficult to tell the reason in
  thousands of instances, and yet the habit and practice of the deadly sin
  of self-pollution is actually ignored; it is even spoken of as a boyish
  folly not to be mentioned, and young men literally burning up with lust
  are mildly spoken of as "sowing their wild oats." Thus the cemetery is
  being filled with masses of the youth of America who, as in Egypt of old,
  fill up the graves of uncleanness and lust. Some time since a prominent
  Christian man was taking exception to my addressing men on this subject;
  observe this! one of his own sons was at that very time near the lunatic
  asylum through these disgusting sins. What folly and madness this is!</p>

  <p>6. <b>Death to True Manhood.</b>&mdash;The question for each one is,
  "In what way are you going to divert the courses of the streams of energy
  which pertain to youthful vigor and manhood?" To be destitute of that
  which may be described as raw material in the human frame, means that no
  really vigorous manhood can have place; to burn up the juices of the
  system in the fires of lust is madness and wanton folly, <!-- Page 418
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page418"></a>[418]</span>but it can be
  done. To divert the currents of life and energy from blood and brain,
  from memory and muscle, in order to secrete it for the shambles of
  prostitution, is death to true manhood; but remember, it can be done! The
  generous liquid life may inspire the brain and blood with noble impulse
  and vital force, or it may be sinned away and drained out of the system
  until the jaded brain, the faded cheek, the enervated young manhood, the
  gray hair, narrow chest, weak voice, and the enfeebled mind show another
  victim in the long catalogue of the degraded through lust.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Sisterhood of Shame and Death.</b>&mdash;Whenever we pass
  the sisterhood of death, and hear the undertone of song, which is one of
  the harlot's methods of advertising, let us recall the words, that these
  represent the "pestilence which walketh in darkness, the destruction that
  wasteth at noonday." The allusion, of course, is to the fact that the
  great majority of these harlots are full of loathsome physical and moral
  disease; with the face and form of an angel, these women "bite like a
  serpent and sting like an adder;" their traffic is not for life, but
  inevitably for shame, disease, and death. Betrayed and seduced
  themselves, they in their turn betray and curse others.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Warning Others.</b>&mdash;Have you never been struck with the
  argument of the Apostle, who, warning others from the corrupt example of
  the fleshy Esau, said, "Lest there be any fornicator or profane person as
  Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright. For ye know that
  even afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected,
  he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with
  tears." Terrible and striking words are these. His birthright sold for a
  mess of meat. The fearful costs of sin&mdash;yes, that is the thought,
  particularly the sin of fornication! Engrave that word upon your memories
  and hearts&mdash;"One mess of meat."</p>

  <p>9. <b>The Harlot's Mess of Meat.</b>&mdash;Remember it, young men,
  when you are tempted to this sin. For a few minutes' sensual pleasure,
  for a mess of harlot's meat, young men are paying out the love of the son
  and brother; they are deceiving, lying, and cheating for a mess of meat;
  for a mess, not seldom of putrid flesh, men have paid down purity and
  prayer, manliness and godliness; for a mess of meat some perhaps have
  donned their best attire, and assumed the manners of the gentleman, and
  then, like an infernal hypocrite, dogged the steps of maiden or harlot to
  satisfy their degrading lust; for a mess of meat young men have deceived
  father and mother, and shrunk from the embrace of <!-- Page 419 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page419"></a>[419]</span>love of the pure-minded
  sister. For the harlot's mess of meat some listening to me have spent
  scores of hours of invaluable time. They have wearied the body, diseased
  and demoralized the mind. The pocket has been emptied, theft committed,
  lies unnumbered told, to play the part of the harlot's
  mate&mdash;perchance a six-foot fool, dragged into the filth and mire of
  the harlot's house. You called her your friend, when, but for her mess of
  meat, you would have passed her like dirt in the street.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Seeing life.</b>&mdash;You consorted with her for your mutual
  shame and death, and then called it "seeing life." Had your mother met
  you, you would have shrunk away like a craven cur. Had your sister
  interviewed you, she had blushed to bear your name; or had she been seen
  by you in company with some other whoremaster, for similar commerce, you
  would have wished that she had been dead. Now what think you of this
  "seeing life?" And it is for this that tens of thousands of strong men in
  our large cities are selling their birthright.</p>

  <p>11. <b>The Devil's Decoys.</b>&mdash;Some may be ready to affirm that
  physical and moral penalties do not appear to overtake all men; that many
  men known to be given to intemperance and sensuality are strong, well,
  and live to a good age. Let us not make any mistake concerning these;
  they are exceptions to the rule; the appearance of health in them is but
  the grossness of sensuality. You have only carefully to look into the
  faces of these men to see that their countenances, eyes, and speech
  betray them. They are simply the devil's decoys.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Grossness of Sensuality.</b>&mdash;The poor degraded harlot
  draws in the victims like a heavily charged lodestone; these men are
  found in large numbers throughout the entire community; they would make
  fine men were they not weighted with the grossness of sensuality; as it
  is, they frequent the race-course, the card-table, the drinking-saloon,
  the music-hall, and the low theaters, which abound in our cities and
  towns; the great majority of these are men of means and leisure. Idleness
  is their curse, their opportunity for sin; you may know them as the
  loungers over refreshment-bars, as the retailers of the latest filthy
  joke, or as the vendors of some disgusting scandal; indeed, it is
  appalling the number of these lepers found both in our business and
  social circles.</p>

<h2>Poisonous Literature and Bad
Pictures.</h2>

  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Obscene Literature.</b>&mdash;No other source contributes so
  much to sexual immorality as obscene literature. The mass of stories
  published in the great weeklies and the cheap novels are mischievous.
  When the devil determines to take charge of a young soul, he often
  employs a very ingenious method. He slyly hands a little novel filled
  with "voluptuous forms," "reclining on bosoms," "languishing eyes,"
  etc.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Moral Forces.</b>&mdash;The world is full of such literature. It
  is easily accessible, for it is cheap, and the young will procure it, and
  therefore become easy prey to its baneful influence and effects. It
  weakens the moral forces of the young, and they thereby fall an easy prey
  before the subtle schemes of the libertine.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Bad Books.</b>&mdash;Bad books play not a small part in the
  corruption of the youth. A bad book is as bad as an evil companion. In
  some respects it is even worse than a living teacher of vice, since it
  may cling to an individual at all times. It will follow him and poison
  his mind with the venom of evil. The influence of bad books in making bad
  boys and men is little appreciated. Few are aware how much evil seed is
  being sown among the young everywhere through the medium of vile
  books.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Sensational Story Books.</b>&mdash;Much of the evil literature
  which is sold in nickel and dime novels, and which constitutes the
  principal part of the contents of such papers as the "Police Gazette,"
  the "Police News," and a large proportion of the sensational story books
  which flood the land. You might better place a coal of fire or a live
  viper in your bosom, than allow yourself to read such a book. The
  thoughts that are implanted in the mind in youth will often stick there
  through life, in spite of all efforts to dislodge them.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Papers and Magazines.</b>&mdash;Many of the papers and magazines
  sold at our news stands, and eagerly sought after by young men and boys,
  are better suited for the parlors of a house of ill-fame than for the
  eyes of pure-minded youth. A newsdealer who will distribute such vile
  sheets ought to be dealt with as an educator in vice and crime, an agent
  of evil, and a recruiting officer of hell and perdition.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Sentimental Literature of Low Fiction.</b>&mdash;Sentimental
  literature, whether impure in its subject matter or not, has <!-- Page
  422 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page422"></a>[422]</span>a direct
  tendency in the direction of impurity. The stimulation of the emotional
  nature, the instilling of sentimental ideas into the minds of the young,
  has a tendency to turn the thoughts into a channel which leads in the
  direction of the formation of vicious habits.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Impressions Left by Reading Questionable
  Literature.</b>&mdash;It is painful to see strong intelligent men and
  youths reading bad books, or feasting their eyes on filthy pictures, for
  the practice is sure to affect their personal purity. Impressions will be
  left which cannot fail to breed a legion of impure thoughts, and in many
  instances criminal deeds. Thousands of elevator boys, clerks, students,
  traveling men, and others, patronize the questionable literature counter
  to an alarming extent.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Nude in Art.</b>&mdash;For years there has been a great
  craze after the nude in art, and the realistic in literature. Many art
  galleries abound in pictures and statuary which cannot fail to fan the
  fires of sensualism, unless the thoughts of the visitor are trained to
  the strictest purity. Why should artists and sculptors persist in
  shocking the finer sensibilities of old and young of both sexes by
  crowding upon their view representations of naked human forms in
  attitudes of luxurious abandon? Public taste may demand it. But let those
  who have the power endeavor to reform public taste.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Widely Diffused.</b>&mdash;Good men have ever lamented the
  pernicious influence of a depraved and perverted literature. But such
  literature has never been so systematically and widely diffused as at the
  present time. This is owing to two causes, its cheapness and the facility
  of conveyance.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Inflame the Passions.</b>&mdash;A very large proportion of the
  works thus put in circulation are of the worst character, tending to
  corrupt the principles, to inflame the passions, to excite impure desire,
  and spread a blight over all the powers of the soul. Brothels are
  recruited from this more than any other source. Those who search the
  trunks of convicted criminals are almost sure to find in them one or more
  of these works; and few prisoners who can read at all fail to enumerate
  among the causes which led them into crime the unhealthy stimulus of this
  depraved and poisonous literature.</p>

  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Nameless Crimes.</b>&mdash;The nameless crimes identified with
  the hushed-up Sodomite cases; the revolting condition of the school of
  Sodomy; the revelations of the Divorce Court concerning the condition of
  what is called national nobility, and upper classes, as well as the
  unclean spirit which attaches to "society papers," has revealed a
  condition which is perfectly disgusting.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Unfaithfulness.</b>&mdash;Unfaithfulness amongst husbands and
  wives in the upper classes is common and adultery rife everywhere;
  mistresses are kept in all directions; thousands of these rich men have
  at least two, and not seldom three establishments.</p>

  <p>3. <b>A Frightful Increase.</b>&mdash;Facts which have come to light
  during the past ten years show a frightful increase in every form of
  licentiousness; the widely extended area over which whoredom and
  degrading lust have thrown the glamor of their fascinating toils is
  simply appalling. <!-- Page 424 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page424"></a>[424]</span></p>

  <p>4. <b>Moral Carnage.</b>&mdash;We speak against the fearful moral
  carnage; would to God that some unmistakable manifestation of the wrath
  of God should come in and put a stop to this huge seed-plot of national
  demoralization! We are reaping in this disgusting centre the harvest of
  corruption which has come from the toleration and encouragements given by
  the legislature, the police, and the magistrates to immorality, vice, and
  sin; the awful fact is, that we are in the midst of the foul and
  f&oelig;tid harvest of lust. Aided by some of the most exalted personages
  in the land, assisted by thousands of educated and wealthy whoremongers
  and adulterers, we are reaping also, in individual physical ugliness and
  deformity, that which has been sown; the puny, ill-formed and mentally
  weak youths and maidens, men and women, to be seen in large numbers in
  our principal towns and cities, represent the widespread nature of the
  curse which has, in a marked manner, impaired the physique, the morality,
  and the intelligence of the nation.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Daily Press.</b>&mdash;The daily press has not had the moral
  courage to say one word; the quality of demoralizing novels such as have
  been produced from the impure brain and unclean imaginations; the subtle,
  clever, and fascinating undermining of the white-winged angel of purity
  by modern sophists, whose prurient and vicious volumes were written to
  throw a halo of charm and beauty about the brilliant courtesan and the
  splendid adulteress; the mixing up of lust and love; the making of
  corrupt passion to stand in the garb of a deep, lasting, and holy
  affection&mdash;these are some of the hideous seedlings which, hidden
  amid the glamor and fascination of the seeming "angel of light," have to
  so large an extent corrupted the morality of the country.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Nightly Exhibitions.</b>&mdash;Some of you know what the nightly
  exhibitions in these garlanded temples of whorish incentive are. There is
  the variety theatre, with its disgusting ballet dancing, and its
  shamelessly indecent photographs exhibited in every direction. What a
  clear gain to morality it would be if the accursed houses were burnt
  down, and forbidden by law ever to be re-built or re-opened; the whole
  scene is designed to act upon and stimulate the lusts and evil passions
  of corrupt men and women.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Confidence and Exposure.</b>&mdash;I hear some of you say,
  cannot some influence be brought to bear upon this plague-spot? Will the
  legislature or congress do nothing? Is the law and moral right to
  continue to be trodden under foot? Are the magistrates and the police
  powerless? The truth is the harlots and whoremongers are master of the
  situation; the moral sense of the legislators, the magistrates, and the
  <!-- Page 425 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page425"></a>[425]</span>police is so low that anything like
  confidence is at present out of the question.</p>

  <p>8. <b>The Sisterhood of Shame and Death.</b>&mdash;It is enough to
  make angels weep to see a great mass of America's wealthy and
  better-class sons full of zeal and on fire with interest in the surging
  hundreds of the sisterhood of shame and death. Many of these men act as
  if they were&mdash;if they do not believe they are&mdash;dogs. No poor
  hunted dog in the streets was ever tracked by a yelping crowd of curs
  more than is the fresh girl or chance of a maid in the accursed streets
  of our large cities. Price is no object, nor parentage, nor home; it is
  the truth to affirm that hundreds and thousands of well-dressed and
  educated men come in order to the gratification of their lusts, and to
  this end they frequent this whole district; they have reached this stage,
  they are being burned up in this fire of lust; men of whom God says,
  "Having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease sin."</p>

  <p>9. <b>Law Makers.</b>&mdash;Now should any member of the legislature
  rise up and testify against this "earthly hell," and speak in defence of
  the moral manhood and <span class="correction" title="text reads `womahood'"
  >womanhood</span> of the nation, he would be greeted as a fanatic, and
  laughed down amid derisive cheers; such has been the experience again and
  again. Therefore attack this great stronghold which for the past thirty
  years has warred and is warring against our social manhood and womanhood,
  and constantly undermining the moral life of the nation; against this
  citadel of licentiousness, this metropolitan centre of crime, and vice,
  and sin, direct your full blast of righteous and manly indignation.</p>

      alt="Tranquil Scene." title="Tranquil Scene." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>10. <b>Temples of Lust.</b>&mdash;Here stand the foul and splendid
  temples of lust, intemperance, and passion, into whose vortex tens of
  thousands of our sons and daughters are constantly being drawn. Let it be
  remembered that this whole area represents the most costly conditions,
  and proves beyond question that an enormous proportion of the wealthy
  manhood of the nation, and we as citizens sustain, partake, and share in
  this carnival of death. Is it any wonder that the robust type of godly
  manhood which used to be found in the legislature, is sadly wanting now,
  or that the wretched caricatures of manhood which find form and place in
  such papers as "Truth" and the "World" are accepted as representing
  "modern society?"</p>

  <p>11. <b>Puritanic Manhood.</b>&mdash;It is a melancholy fact that by
  reason of uncleanness, we have almost lost regard for the type of
  puritanic manhood which in the past held aloft the standard of a chaste
  and holy life; such men in this day are spoken of as "too slow" as
  "weak-kneed," and <!-- Page 426 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page426"></a>[426]</span>"goody-goody" men. Let me recall that
  word, the fast and indecently-dressed "things," the animals of easy
  virtue, the "respectable" courtesans that flirt, chaff, gamble, and waltz
  with well-known high-class licentious lepers&mdash;such is the ideal of
  womanhood which a large proportion of our large city society accepts,
  fawns upon, and favors.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Shameful Conditions.</b>&mdash;Perhaps one of the most inhuman
  and shameful conditions of modern fashionable society, both in England
  and America, is that which wealthy men and women who are married destroy
  their own children in the embryo stage of being, and become murderers
  thereby. This is done to prevent what should be one of our chief glories,
  viz., large and well-developed home and family life.</p>

<h2>The Prostitution of Men.</h2>

<h3>CAUSE AND REMEDY.</h3>

  <p>1. <b>Exposed Youth.</b>&mdash;Generally even in the beginning of the
  period when sexual uneasiness begins to show itself in the boy, he is
  exposed in schools, institutes, and elsewhere to the temptations of
  secret vice, which is transmitted from youth to youth, like a contagious
  corruption, and which in thousands destroys the first germs of virility.
  Countless numbers of boys are addicted to these vices for years. That
  they do not in the beginning of nascent puberty proceed to sexual
  intercourse with women, is generally due to youthful timidity, which
  dares not reveal its desire, or from want of experience for finding
  opportunities. The desire is there, for the heart is already
  corrupted.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Boyhood Timidity Overcome.</b>&mdash;Too often a common boy's
  timidity is overcome by chance or by seduction, which is rarely lacking
  in great cities where prostitution is flourishing, and thus numbers of
  boys immediately after the transition period of youth, in accordance with
  the previous secret practice, accustom themselves to the association with
  prostitute women, and there young manhood and morals are soon lost
  forever.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Marriage-bed Resolutions.</b>&mdash;Most men of the educated
  classes enter the marriage-bed with the consciousness of leaving behind
  them a whole army of prostitutes or seduced women, in whose arms they
  cooled their passions and spent the vigor of their youth. But with such a
  past the married man does not at the same time leave behind him its
  influence on his inclinations. The habit of having a feminine being at
  his disposal for every rising appetite, and the desire for change
  inordinately indulged for years, generally make themselves felt again as
  soon as the honeymoon is over. Marriage will not make a morally corrupt
  man all at once a good man and a model husband.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Injustice of Man.</b>&mdash;Now, although many men are in a
  certain sense "not worthy to unloose the latchet of the shoes" of the
  commonest woman, much less to "unfasten her girdle," yet they make the
  most extravagant demands on the feminine sex. Even the greatest
  debauchee, who has spent his vigor in the arms of a hundred courtesans,
  will cry out fraud and treachery if he does not receive his newly married
  bride as an untouched virgin. Even the most dissolute husband will look
  on his wife as deserving of death if his daily infidelity is only once
  reciprocated. <!-- Page 428 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page428"></a>[428]</span></p>

  <p>5. <b>Unjust Demands.</b>&mdash;The greater the injustice a husband
  does to his wife, the less he is willing to submit to from her; the
  oftener he becomes unfaithful to her, the stricter he is in demanding
  faithfulness from her. We see that despotism nowhere denies its own
  nature: the more a despot deceives and abuses his people, the more
  submissiveness and faithfulness he demands of them.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Suffering Women.</b>&mdash;Who can be astonished at the many
  unhappy marriages, if he knows how unworthy most men are of their wives?
  Their virtues they rarely can appreciate, and their vices they generally
  call out by their own. Thousands of women suffer from the results of a
  mode of life of which they, having remained pure in their thought, have
  no conception whatever; and many an unsuspecting wife nurses her husband
  with tenderest care in sicknesses which are nothing more than the
  consequences of his amours with other women.</p>

  <p>7. <b>An Inhuman Criminal.</b>&mdash;When at last, after long years of
  delusion and endurance, the scales drop from the eyes of the wife, and
  revenge or despair drives her into a hostile position towards her lord
  and master, she is an inhuman criminal, and the hue and cry against the
  fickleness of women and the falsity of their nature is endless. Oh, the
  injustice of society and the injustice of cruel man. Is there no relief
  for helpless women that are bound by the ties of marriage to men who are
  nothing but rotten corruption?</p>

  <p>8. <b>Vulgar Desire.</b>&mdash;The habit of regarding the end and aim
  of woman only from the most vulgar side&mdash;not to respect in her the
  noble human being, but to see in her only the instrument of sensual
  desire&mdash;is carried so far among men that they will allow it to force
  into the background considerations among themselves, which they otherwise
  pretend to rank very high.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs430.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/430.jpg"
      alt="Married Couple." title="Married Couple." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>9. <b>The Only Remedy.</b>&mdash;But when the feeling of women has
  once been driven to indignation with respect to the position which they
  occupy, it is to be hoped that they will compel men to be pure before
  marriage, and they will remain loyal after marriage.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Worse than Savages.</b>&mdash;With all our civilization we are
  put to shame even by the savages. The savages know of no fastidiousness
  of the sexual instinct and of no brothels. We are, indeed, likewise
  savages, but in quite a different sense. Proof of this <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `if'">is</span> especially furnished
  by our youth. But that our students, and young men in general, usually
  pass through the school of corruption and drag the filth of the road
  which they have traversed before marriage along <!-- Page 429 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page429"></a>[429]</span>with them throughout
  life, is not their fault so much as the fault of prejudices and of our
  political and social conditions that prohibits a proper education, and
  the placing of the right kind of literature on these subjects into the
  hands of young people.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Reason and Remedy.</b>&mdash;Keep the youth pure by a thorough
  system of plain unrestricted training. The seeds of immorality are sown
  in youth, and the secret vice eats out their young manhood often before
  the age of puberty. They develop a bad character as they grow older.
  Young girls are ruined, and licentiousness and prostitution flourish.
  Keep the boys pure and the harlot would soon lose her vocation. Elevate
  the morals of the boys, and you will have pure men and moral
  husbands.</p>

  <p>1. <b>Insult to Mother or Sister</b>.&mdash;Young men, it can never
  under any circumstances be right for you to do to a woman that, which, if
  another man did to your mother or sister, you could never forgive! The
  very thought is revolting. Let us suppose a man guilty of this shameful
  sin, and I apprehend that each of us would feel ready to shoot the
  villain. We are not justifying the shooting, but appealing to your
  instinctive sense of right, in order to show the enormity of this fearful
  crime, and to fasten strong conviction in your mind against this sin.
  <!-- Page 431 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page431"></a>[431]</span></p>

  <p>2. <b>A Ruined Sister</b>.&mdash;What would you think of a man, no
  matter what his wealth, culture, or gentlemanly bearing, who should lay
  himself out for the seduction and shame of your beloved sister? Her very
  name now reminds you of the purest affection: think of her, if you can
  bear it, ruined in character, and soon to become an unhappy mother. To
  whom can you introduce her? What can you say concerning her? How can her
  own brothers and sisters associate with her? and, mark! all this personal
  and relative misery caused by this genteel villain's degrading
  passion.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Young Man Lost</b>.&mdash;Another terrible result of this sin is
  the practical overthrow of natural affection which it effects. A young
  man comes from his father's house to Chicago. Either through his own lust
  or through the corrupt companions that he finds in the house of business
  where he resides, he becomes the companion of lewd women. The immediate
  result is a bad conscience, a sense of shame, and a breach in the
  affections of home. Letters are less frequent, careless, and brief. He
  cannot manifest true love now. He begins to shrink from his sister and
  mother, and well he may.</p>

  <p>4. <b>The Harlot's Influence</b>.&mdash;He has spent the strength of
  his affection and love for home. In their stead the wretched harlot has
  filled him with unholy lust. His brain and heart refuse to yield him the
  love of the son and brother. His hand can not write as aforetime, or at
  best, his expressions become a hypocritical pretence. Fallen into the
  degradation of the fornicator, he has changed a mother's love and
  sister's affection for the cursed fellowship of the woman "whose house is
  the way to hell." (Prov. VII. 27.)</p>

  <p>5. <b>The Way of Death</b>.&mdash;Observe, that directly the law of
  God is broken, and wherever promiscuous intercourse between the sexes
  takes place, gonorrh&oelig;a, syphilis, and every other form of venereal
  disease is seen in hideous variety. It is only true to say that thousands
  of both sexes are slain annually by these horrible diseases. What must be
  the moral enormity of a sin, which, when committed, produces in vast
  numbers of cases such frightful physical and moral destruction as that
  which is here portrayed?</p>

  <p>6. <b>A Harlot's Woes</b>.&mdash;Would to God that something might be
  done to rescue fallen women from their low estate. We speak of them as
  "fallen women". Fallen, indeed, they are, but surely not more deserving
  of the application of that term than the "fallen men" who are their
  partners and paramours. It is easy to use the words, "a fallen woman",
  but who can apprehend all that is involved in the <!-- Page 432 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page432"></a>[432]</span>expression, seeing that
  every purpose for which God created woman is prostituted and destroyed?
  She is now neither maiden, wife, nor mother; the sweet names of sister
  and betrothed can have no legitimate application in her case.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Penalties for Lost Virtue.</b>&mdash;Can the harlot be
  welcomed where either children, brothers, sisters, wife, or husband are
  found? Surely, no. Home is a sphere alien to the harlot's estate. See
  such an one wherever you may&mdash;she is a fallen outcast from woman's
  high estate. Her existence&mdash;for she does not live&mdash;now
  culminates in one dread issue, viz., prostitution. She sleeps, but awakes
  a harlot. She rises in the late morning hours, but her object is
  prostitution; she washes, dresses, and braids her hair, but it is with
  one foul purpose before her. To this end she eats, drinks, and is
  clothed. To this end her house is hidden and the blinds are drawn.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Lost Forever.</b>&mdash;To this end she applies the unnatural
  cosmetique, and covers herself with sweet perfumes, which vainly try to
  hide her disease and shame. To this end she decks herself with dashing
  finery and tawdry trappings, and with bold, unwomanly mien essays the
  streets of the great city. To this end she is loud and coarse and
  impudent. To this end she is the prostituted "lady," with simpering
  words, and smiles, and glamour of refined deceit. To this end an angel
  face, a devil in disguise. There is one foul and ghastly purpose towards
  which all her energies now tend. So low has she fallen, so lost is she to
  all the design of woman, that she exists for one foul purpose only, viz.,
  to excite, stimulate, and gratify the lusts of degraded, ungodly men.
  Verily, the word "prostitute" has an awful meaning. What plummet can
  sound the depths of a woman's fall who has become a harlot?</p>

  <p>9. <b>Sound the Alarm.</b>&mdash;Remember, young man, you can never
  rise above the degradation of the companionship of lewd women. Your
  virtue once lost is lost forever. Remember, young woman, your wealth or
  riches is your good name and good character&mdash;you have nothing else.
  Give a man your virtue and he will forsake you, and you will be forsaken
  by all the world. Remember that purity of purpose brings nobility of
  character, and an honorable life is the joy and security of mankind.</p>

  <p>1. <b>Moral Lepers.</b>&mdash;We cannot but denounce in the strongest
  terms, the profligacy of many married men. Not content with the
  moderation permitted in the divine appointed relationship of marriage,
  they become adulterers, in order to gratify their accursed lust. The man
  in them is trodden down by the sensual beast which reigns supreme. These
  are the moral outlaws that make light of this scandalous social iniquity,
  and by their damnable example encourage young men to sin.</p>

  <p>2. <b>A Sad Condition.</b>&mdash;It is constantly affirmed by
  prostitutes, that amongst married men are found their chief supporters.
  Evidence from such a quarter must be received with considerable caution.
  Nevertheless, we believe that there is much truth in this statement.
  Here, again, we lay <!-- Page 434 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page434"></a>[434]</span>the ax to the root of the tree; the
  married man who dares affirm that there is a particle of physical
  necessity for this sin, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. Whether
  these men be princes, peers, legislators, professional men, mechanics, or
  workmen, they are moral pests, a scandal to the social state, and a curse
  to the nation.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Excesses.</b>&mdash;Many married men exhaust themselves by these
  excesses; they become irritable, liable to cold, to rheumatic affections,
  and nervous depression. They find themselves weary when they rise in the
  morning. Unfitted for close application to business, they become dilatory
  and careless, often lapsing into entire lack of energy, and not seldom
  into the love of intoxicating stimulants. Numbers of husbands and wives
  entering upon these experiences lose the charm of health, the
  cheerfulness of life and converse. Home duties become irksome to the
  wife; the brightness, vivacity, and bloom natural to her earlier years,
  decline; she is spoken of as highly nervous, poorly, and weak, when the
  whole truth is that she is suffering from physical exhaustion which she
  cannot bear. Her features become angular, her hair prematurely gray, she
  rapidly settles down into the nervous invalid, constantly needing medical
  aid, and, if possible, change of air.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Ignorance.</b>&mdash;These conditions are brought about in many
  cases through ignorance on the part of those who are married. Multitudes
  of men have neither read, heard, nor known the truth of this question. We
  sympathize with our fellow-men in this, that we have been left in
  practical ignorance concerning the exceeding value and legitimate uses of
  these functions of our being. Some know, that, had they known these
  things in the early days of their married life, it would have proved to
  them knowledge of exceeding value. If this counsel is followed, thousands
  of homes will scarcely know the need of the physician's presence.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Animal Passion.</b>&mdash;Common-sense teaches that children who
  are begotten in the heat of animal passion, are likely to be licentious
  when they grow up. Many parents through excesses of eating and drinking,
  become inflamed with wine and strong drink., They are sensualists, and
  consequently, morally diseased. Now, if in such conditions men beget
  their children, who can affect surprise if they develop licentious
  tendencies? Are not such parents largely to blame? Are they not criminals
  in a high degree? Have they not fouled their own nest, and transmitted to
  their children predisposition to moral evil?</p>

  <p>6. <b>Fast Young Men.</b>&mdash;Many of our "fast young men" have been
  thus corrupted, even as the children of the <!-- Page 435 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page435"></a>[435]</span>intemperate are proved
  to have been. Certainly no one can deny that many of our "well-bred"
  young men are little better than "high-class dogs" so lawless are they,
  and ready for the arena of licentiousness.</p>

  <p>7. <b>The Pure-Minded Wife.</b>&mdash;Happily, as tens of thousands of
  husbands can testify, the pure-minded wife and mother is not carried
  away, as men are liable to be, with the force of animal passion. Were it
  not so, the tendencies to licentiousness in many sons would be stronger
  than they are. In the vast majority of cases suggestion is never made
  except by the husband, and it is a matter of deepest gratitude and
  consideration, that the true wife may become a real helpmeet in
  restraining this desire in the husband.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Young Wife and Children.</b>&mdash;We often hear it stated that
  a young wife has her children quickly. This cannot happen to the majority
  of women without injury to health and jeopardy to life. The law which
  rendered it imperative for the land to lie fallow in order to rest and
  gain renewed strength, is only another illustration of the unity which
  pervades physical conditions everywhere. It should be known that if a
  mother nurses her own babe, and the child is not weaned until it is nine
  or ten months old, the mother, except in rare cases, will not become
  enceinte again, though cohabitation with the husband takes place.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Selfish and Unnatural Conduct.</b>&mdash;It is natural and
  rational that a mother should feed her own children; in the selfish and
  unnatural conduct of many mothers, who, to avoid the self-denial and
  patience which are required, hand the little one over to the wet-nurse,
  or to be brought up by hand, is found in many cases the cause and reason
  of the unnatural haste of child-bearing. Mothers need to be taught that
  the laws of nature cannot be broken without penalty. For every woman
  whose health has been weakened through nursing her child, a hundred have
  lost strength and health through marital excesses. The haste of having
  children is the costly penalty which women pay for shirking the mother's
  duty to the child.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Law of God.</b>&mdash;So graciously has the law of God been
  arranged in regard to the mother's strength, that, if it be obeyed, there
  will be, as a rule, an interval of at least from eighteen months to two
  years between the birth of one child and that of another. Every married
  man should abstain during certain natural seasons. In this periodical
  recurrence God has instituted to every husband the law of restraint, and
  insisted upon self-control.</p>

  <p>11. <b>To Young People Who Are Married.</b>&mdash;Be exceedingly
  careful of license and excess in your intercourse with <!-- Page 436
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page436"></a>[436]</span>one another.
  Do not needlessly expose, by undress, the body. Let not the purity of
  love degenerate into unholy lust. See to it that you walk according to
  the divine Word, "Dwelling together as being heirs of the grace of life,
  that your prayers be not hindered."</p>

  <p>12. <b>Lost Powers.</b>&mdash;Many young men after their union showed
  a marked difference. They lost much of their natural vivacity, energy,
  and strength of voice. Their powers of application, as business men,
  students, and ministers, had declined, as also their enterprise, fervor,
  and kindliness. They had become irritable, dull, pale, and complaining.
  Many cases of rheumatic fever have been induced through impoverishment,
  caused by excesses on the part of young married men.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Middle Age.</b>&mdash;After middle age the sap of a man's life
  declines in quantity. A man who intends close application to the
  ministry, to scientific or literary pursuits, where great demands are
  made upon the brain, must restrain this passion. The supplies for the
  brain and nervous system are absorbed, and the seed diverted through
  sexual excesses in the marriage relationship, by fornication, or by any
  other form of immorality, the man's power must decline: that to this very
  cause may be attributed the failure and breakdown of so many men of
  middle age.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Intoxicating Drinks.</b>&mdash;By all means avoid intoxicating
  drinks. Immorality and alcoholic stimulants, as we have shown, are
  intimately related to one another. Wine and strong drink inflame the
  blood, and heat the passions. Attacking the brain, they warp the
  judgment, and weaken the power of restraint. Avoid what is called good
  living; it is madness to allow the pleasures of the table to corrupt and
  corrode the human body. We are not designed for gourmands, much less for
  educated pigs. Cold water bathing, water as a beverage, simple and
  wholesome food, regularity of sleep, plenty of exercise; games such as
  cricket, football, tennis, boating, or bicycling, are among the best
  possible preventives against lust and animal passion.</p>

  <p>15. <b>Beware of Idleness.</b>&mdash;Indolent leisure means an
  unoccupied mind. When young men lounge along the streets, in this
  condition they become an easy prey to the sisterhood of shame and death.
  Bear in mind that evil thoughts precede evil actions. The hand of the
  worst thief will not steal until the thief within operates upon the hand
  without. The members of the body which are capable of becoming
  instruments of sin, are not involuntary actors. Lustful desires must
  proceed from brain and heart, ere the fire that consumes burns in the
  member.</p>

<h2>A Private Talk to Young Men.</h2>

  <p>1. The most valuable and useful organs of the body are those which are
  capable of the greatest dishonor, abuse and corruption. What a snare the
  wonderful organism of the eye may become when used to read corrupt books
  or look upon licentious scenes at the theatre, or when used to meet the
  fascinating gaze of the harlot! What an instrument for depraving the
  whole man may be found in the matchless powers of the brain, the hand,
  the ear, the mouth, or the tongue! What potent instruments may these
  become in accomplishing the ruin of the whole being for time and
  eternity!</p>

  <p>2. In like manner the organ concerning the uses of which I am to
  speak, has been, and continues to be, made one of the chief instruments
  of man's immorality, shame, disease, and death. How important to know
  what the legitimate uses of this member of the body are, and how great
  the <!-- Page 438 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page438"></a>[438]</span>dignity conferred upon us in the
  possession of this gift. On the human side this gift may be truly said to
  bring men nearer to the high and solemn relationship of the Creator than
  any other which they possess.</p>

  <p>3. I first deal with the destructive sin of self-abuse. There can be
  little doubt that vast numbers of boys are guilty of this practice. In
  many cases the degrading habit has been taught by others, e.g., by elder
  boys at school, where association largely results in mutual corruption.
  With others, the means of sensual gratification is found out by personal
  action; whilst in other cases fallen and depraved men have not hesitated
  to debauch the minds of mere children by teaching them this debasing
  practice.</p>

  <p>4. Thousands of youths and young men have only to use the
  looking-glass to see the portrait of one guilty of this loathsome sin.
  The effects are plainly discernible in the boy's appearance. The face and
  hands become pale and bloodless. The eye is destitute of its natural fire
  and lustre. The flesh is soft and flabby, the muscles limp and lacking
  healthy firmness. In cases where the habit has become confirmed, and
  where the system has been drained of this vital force, it is seen in
  positive ugliness, in a pale and cadaverous appearance, slovenly gait,
  slouching walk, and an impaired memory.</p>

  <p>5. It is obvious that if the most vital physical force of a boy's life
  is being spent through this degrading habit&mdash;a habit, be it
  observed, of rapid growth, great strength, and difficult to
  break&mdash;he must develop badly. In thousands of cases the result is
  seen in a low stature, contracted chest, weak lungs, and liability to
  sore throat. Tendency to cold, indigestion, depression, drowsiness, and
  idleness, are results distinctly traceable to this deadly practice.
  Pallor of countenance, nervous and rheumatic affections, loss of memory,
  epilepsy, paralysis, and insanity find their principal predisposing cause
  in the same shameful waste of life. The want of moral force and strength
  of mind often observable is youths and young men is largely induced by
  this destructive and deadly sin.</p>

  <p>6. Large numbers of youths pass from an exhausted boyhood into the
  weakness, intermittent fevers, and consumption, which are said to carry
  off so many. If the deaths were attributed primarily to loss of strength
  occasioned by self-pollution, it would be much nearer the truth. It is
  monstrous to suppose that a boy who comes from healthy parents should
  decline and die. Without a shade of doubt the chief cause of decay and
  death amongst youths and young men, is to be traced to this baneful
  habit. <!-- Page 439 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page439"></a>[439]</span></p>

  <p>7. It is a well-known fact that any man who desires to excel and
  retain his excellence as an accurate shot, an oarsman, a pedestrian, a
  pugilist, a first-class cricketer, bicyclist, student, artist, or
  literary man, must abstain from self-pollution and fornication. Thousands
  of school boys and students lose their positions in the class, and are
  plucked at the time of their examination by reason of failure of memory,
  through lack of nerve and vital force, caused mainly by draining the
  physical frame of the seed which is the vigor of the life.</p>

  <p>8. It is only true to say that thousands of young men in the early
  stages of a licentious career would rather lose a right hand than have
  their mothers or sisters know what manner of men they are. From the side
  of the mothers and sisters it may also be affirmed that, were they aware
  of the real character of those brothers and sons, they would wish that
  they had never been born.</p>

  <p>9. Let it be remembered that sexual desire is not in itself
  dishonorable or sinful, any more than hunger, thirst, or any other lawful
  and natural desire is. It is the gratification by unlawful means of this
  appetite which renders it so corrupting and iniquitous.</p>

  <p>10. Leisure means the opportunity to commit sin. Unclean pictures are
  sought after and feasted upon, paragraphs relating to cases of divorce
  and seduction are eagerly read, papers and books of an immoral character
  and tendency greedily devoured, low and disgusting conversation indulged
  in and repeated.</p>

  <p>11. The practical and manly counsel to every youth and young man is,
  entire abstinence from indulgence of the sexual faculty until such time
  as the marriage relationship is entered upon. Neither is there, nor can
  there be, any exception to this rule.</p>

  <p>12. No man can affirm that self-denial ever injured him. On the
  contrary, self-restraint has been liberty, strength and blessing. Beware
  of the deceitful streams of temporary gratification, whose eddying
  current drifts towards license, shame, disease and death. Remember, how
  quickly moral power declines, how rapidly the edge of the fatal maelstrom
  is reached, how near the vortex, how terrible the penalty, how fearful
  the sentence of everlasting punishment.</p>

  <p>13. Be a young man of principle, honor, and preserve your powers. How
  can you look an innocent girl in the face when you are degrading your
  manhood with the vilest practice? Keep your mind and life pure, and
  nobility will be your crown.</p>

<h2>Remedies for the Social Evil.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Man Responsible.</b>&mdash;Every great social reform must begin
  with the male sex. They must either lead, or give it its support.
  Prostitution is a sin wholly of their own making. All the misery, all the
  lust, as well as all the blighting consequences, are chargeable wholly to
  the uncontrolled sexual passion of the male. To reform sinful women,
  <i>reform the men</i>. Teach them that the physiological truth means
  permanent moral, physical and mental benefit, while seductive indulgence
  blights and ruins.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Contagious Diseases.</b>&mdash;A man or woman cannot long live
  an impure life without sooner or later contracting <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `dis-disease' over line-break"
  >disease</span> which brings to every sufferer not only moral
  degradation, but often serious and vital injuries and many times death
  itself becomes the only relief.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Should It Be Regulated by Law?</b>&mdash;Dr. G. J. Ziegler, of
  Philadelphia, in several medical articles says that the act of sexual
  connection should be made in itself the solemnization of marriage, and
  that when any such single act can be proven against an unmarried man, by
  an unmarried woman, the latter be at once invested with all the legal
  privileges of a wife. By bestowing this power on women very few men would
  risk the dangers of the society of a dissolute and scheming woman who
  might exercise the right to force him to a marriage and ruin his
  reputation and life. The strongest objection of this would be that it
  would increase the temptation to destroy the purity of married women, for
  they could be approached without danger of being forced into another
  marriage. But this objection could easily be harmonized with a good
  system of well regulated laws. Many means have been tried to mitigate the
  social evils, but with little encouragement. In the city of Paris a
  system of registration has been inaugurated and houses of prostitution
  are under the supervision of the police, yet prostitution has not been in
  any degree diminished. Similar methods have been tried in other European
  towns, but without satisfactory results.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Moral Influence.</b>&mdash;Let it be an imperative to every
  clergyman, to every educator, to every statesman and to every
  philanthropist, to every father and to every mother, to impart that moral
  influence which may guide and direct the youth of the land into the
  natural channels of morality, chastity and health. Then, and not till
  then, shall we see righteous laws and rightly enforced for the mitigation
  and extermination of the modern house of prostitution.</p>

<h2>The Selfish Slaves of Doses of Disease
and Death.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">

      alt="A Turkish Cigarette Girl." title="A Turkish Cigarette Girl." /></a>
    A TURKISH CIGARETTE GIRL.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Most Devilish Intoxication.</b>&mdash;What is the most devilish,
  subtle alluring, unconquerable, hopeless and deadly form of intoxication,
  with which science struggles and to which it often succumbs; which eludes
  the restrictive grasp of legislation; lurks behind lace curtains, hides
  in luxurious boudoirs, haunts the solitude of the study, and with waxen
  <!-- Page 442 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page442"></a>[442]</span>face, furtive eyes and palsied step
  totters to the secret recesses of its self-indulgence? It is the
  drunkenness of drugs, and woe be unto him that crosseth the threshold of
  its dream-curtained portal, for though gifted with the strength of
  Samson, the courage of Richard and the genius of Archimedes, he shall
  never return, and of him it is written that forever he leaves hope
  behind.</p>

  <p>2. <b>The Material Satan.</b>&mdash;The material Satan in this
  sensuous syndicate of soul and body-destroying drugs is opium, and next
  in order of hellish potency come cocaine and chloral.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Gum Opium.</b>&mdash;Gum opium, from which the sulphate of
  morphine is made, is the dried juice of the poppy, and is obtained
  principally in the orient. Taken in moderate doses it acts specially upon
  the nervous system, deadens sensibility, and the mind becomes inactive.
  When used habitually and excessively it becomes a tonic, which stimulates
  the whole nervous system, producing intense mental exaltation and
  delusive visions. When the effects wear off, proportionate lassitude
  follows, which begets an insatiate and insane craving for the drug. Under
  the repeated strain of the continually increasing doses, which have to be
  taken to renew the desired effect, the nervous system finally becomes
  exhausted, and mind and body are utterly and hopelessly wrecked.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Cocaine.</b>&mdash;Cocaine is extracted from the leaves of the
  Peruvian cocoa tree, and exerts a decided influence upon the nervous
  system, somewhat akin to that of coffee. It increases the heart action
  and is said to be such an exhilarant that the natives of the Andes are
  enabled to make extraordinary forced marches by chewing the leaves
  containing it. Its after effects are more depressing even than those of
  opium, and insanity more frequently results from its use.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Chloral.</b>&mdash;The name which is derived from the first two
  syllables of chlorine and alcohol, is made by passing dry chlorine gas in
  a continuous stream through absolute alcohol for six or eight weeks. It
  is a hypnotic or sleep-producing drug, and in moderate doses acts on the
  caliber of the blood vessels of the brain, producing a soothing effect,
  especially in cases of passive congestion. Some patent medicines contain
  chloral, bromide and <span class="correction" title="text reads `hyoseamus', `hyoscymus' is his spelling on p. 363 (it should really be `hyoscyamus')"
  >hyoscymus</span>, and they have a large sale, being bought by persons of
  wealth, who do not know what they are composed of and recklessly take
  them for the effect they produce.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Victims Rapidly Increasing.</b>&mdash;"From my experience," said
  a leading and conservative druggist, "I infer that the <!-- Page 443
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page443"></a>[443]</span>number of what
  are termed opium, cocaine, and chloral "fiends" is rapidly increasing,
  and is greater by two or three hundred per cent than a year ago, with
  twice as many women as men represented. I should say that one person out
  of every fifty is a victim of this frightful habit, which claims its
  doomed votaries from the extremes of social life, those who have the most
  and the least to live for, the upper classes and the cyprian,
  professional men of the finest intelligence, fifty per cent of whom are
  doctors and walk into the pit with eyes wide open. And lawyers and other
  professional men must be added to this fated vice."</p>

  <p>7. <b>Destroys the Moral Fiber.</b>&mdash;"It is a habit which utterly
  destroys the moral fiber of its slaves, and makes unmitigated liars and
  thieves and forgers of them, and even murder might be added to the list
  of crimes, were no other road left open to the gratification of its
  insatiate and insane appetite. I do not know of a single case in which it
  has been mastered, but I do know of many where the end has been
  unspeakable misery, disgrace, suffering, insanity and death."</p>

  <p>8. <b>Shameful Death.</b>&mdash;To particularize further would be
  profitless so far as the beginners are concerned, but would to heaven
  that those not within the shadow of this shameful death would take
  warning from those who are. There are no social or periodical drunkards
  in this sort of intoxication. The vice is not only solitary, unsocial and
  utterly selfish, but incessant and increasing in its demands.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Appetite Stronger than for Liquor.</b>&mdash;This appetite is
  far stronger and more uncontrollable than that for liquor, and we can
  spot its victim as readily as though he were an ordinary bummer. He has a
  pallid complexion, a shifting, shuffling manner and can't look you in the
  face. If you manage to catch his eye for an instant you will observe that
  its pupil is contracted to an almost invisible point. It is no
  exaggeration to say that he would barter his very soul for that which
  indulgence has made him too poor to purchase, and where artifice fails he
  will grovel in abject agony of supplication for a few grains. At the same
  time he resorts to all kinds of miserable and transparent shifts, to
  conceal his degradation. He never buys for himself, but always for some
  fictitious person, and often resorts to purchasing from distant
  points.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Opium Smoking.</b>&mdash;"Opium smoking," said another
  representative druggist, "is almost entirely confined to the Chinese and
  they seem to thrive on it. Very few others hit the pipe that we know
  of."</p>

<p><!-- Page 444 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page444"></a>[444]</span></p>

  <p>11. <b>Malt and Alcoholic Drunkenness.</b>&mdash;Alcoholic stimulants
  have a record of woe second to nothing. Its victims are annually marching
  to drunkards' graves by the thousands. Drunkards may be divided into
  three classes: First, the accidental or social drunkard; second, the
  periodical or spasmodic drunkard; and third, the sot.</p>

  <p>12. <b>The Accidental or Social Drunkard</b> is yet on safe ground. He
  has not acquired the dangerous craving for liquor. It is only on special
  occasions that he yields to excessive indulgence; sometimes in meeting a
  friend, or at some political blow-out. On extreme occasions he will
  indulge until he becomes a helpless victim, and usually as he grows older
  occasions will increase, and step by step he will be lead nearer to the
  precipice of ruin.</p>

  <p>13. <b>The Periodical or Spasmodic Drunkard</b>, with whom it is
  always the unexpected which occurs, and who at intervals exacts from his
  accumulated capital the usury of as prolonged a spree as his nerves and
  stomach will stand. Science is inclined to charitably label this specimen
  of man a sort of a physiologic puzzle, to be as much pitied as blamed.
  Given the benefit of every doubt, when he starts off on one of his
  hilarious tangents, he becomes a howling nuisance; if he has a family,
  keeps them continually on the ragged edge of apprehension, and is
  unanimously pronounced a "holy terror" by his friends. His life and
  future is an uncertainty. He is unreliable and cannot be long trusted.
  Total reformation is the only hope, but it rarely is accomplished.</p>

  <p>14. <b>The Sot.</b>&mdash;A blunt term that needs no defining, for
  even the children comprehend the hopeless degradation it implies. Laws to
  restrain and punish him are framed; societies to protect and reform him
  are organized, and mostly in vain. He is prone in life's very gutter;
  bloated, reeking and polluted with the doggery's slops and filth. He can
  fall but a few feet lower, and not until he stumbles into an unmarked,
  unhonored grave, where kind mother earth and the merciful mantle of
  oblivion will cover and conceal the awful wreck he made of God's own
  image. To the casual observer, the large majority of the community, these
  three phases, at whose vagaries many laugh, and over whose consequences
  millions mourn, comprehend intoxication and its results, from the filling
  of the cup to its shattering fall from the nerveless hand, and this is
  the end of the matter. Would to God that it were! for at that it would be
  bad enough. But it is not, for wife, children and friends must suffer and
  drink the cup of trouble and sorrow to its dregs.</p>

  <p>Cigarettes have been analyzed, and the most physicians and chemists
  were surprised to find how much opium is put into them. A tobacconist
  himself says that "the extent to which drugs are used in cigarettes is
  appalling." "Havana flavoring" for this same purpose is sold everywhere
  by the thousand barrels. This flavoring is made from the tonka-bean,
  which contains a deadly poison. The wrappers, warranted to be rice paper,
  are sometimes made of common paper, and sometimes of the filthy scrapings
  of ragpickers bleached white with arsenic. What a thing for human
  lungs.</p>

  <p>The habit burns up good health, good resolutions, good manners, good
  memories, good faculties, and often honesty and truthfulness as well.</p>

  <p>Cases of epilepsy, insanity and death are frequently reported as the
  result of smoking cigarettes, while such physicians as Dr. Lewis Sayre,
  Dr. Hammond, and Sir Morell Mackenzie of England, name heart trouble,
  blindness, cancer and other diseases as occasioned by it.</p>

  <p>Leading physicians of America unanimously condemn <!-- Page 450
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page450"></a>[450]</span>cigarette
  smoking as "one of the vilest and most destructive evils that ever befell
  the youth of any country," declaring that "its direct tendency is a
  deterioration of the race."</p>

  <p>Look at the pale, wilted complexion of a boy who indulges in excessive
  cigarette smoking. It takes no physician to diagnose his case, and death
  will surely mark for his own every boy and young man who will follow up
  the habit. It is no longer a matter of guess. It is a scientific fact
  which the microscope in every case verifies.</p>

    INNOCENT YOUTH.
  </div>
  <p>Few persons are aware of the extent to which masturbation or
  self-pollution is practiced by the young of both sexes in civilized
  society.</p>

<h3>SYMPTOMS.</h3>

  <p>The hollow, sunken eye, the blanched cheek, the withered hands, and
  emaciated frame, and the listless life, have other sources than the
  ordinary illnesses of all large communities.</p>

  <p>When a child, after having given proofs of memory and intelligence,
  experiences daily more and more difficulty in retaining and understanding
  what is taught him, it is not only from unwillingness and idleness, as is
  commonly supposed, but from a disease eating out life itself, brought on
  by a self-abuse of the private organs. Besides the slow and progressive
  derangement of his or her health, the diminished energy of application,
  the languid movement, the stooping gait, the desertion of social games,
  the solitary walk, late rising, livid and sunken eye, and many other
  symptoms, will fix the attention of every intelligent and competent
  guardian of youth that something is wrong.</p>

<p><!-- Page 453 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page453"></a>[453]</span></p>

<h3>MARRIED PEOPLE.</h3>

  <p>Nor are many persons sufficiently aware of the ruinous extent to which
  the amative propensity is indulged by married persons. The matrimonial
  ceremony does, indeed, sanctify the act of sexual intercourse, but it can
  by no means atone for nor obviate the consequences of its abuse.
  Excessive indulgence in the married relation is, perhaps, as much owing
  to the force of habit, as to the force of the sexual appetite.</p>

      alt="Guard well the Cradle." title="Guard well the Cradle." /></a>
    GUARD WELL THE CRADLE.

    <p class="poem">EDUCATION CANNOT BEGIN TOO YOUNG.</p>
  </div>
<h3>EXTREME YOUTH.</h3>

  <p>More lamentable still is the effect of inordinate sexual excitement of
  the young and unmarried. It is not very uncommon to find a confirmed
  onanist, or, rather, masturbator, who has not yet arrived at the period
  of puberty. Many cases are related in which young boys and girls, from
  eight to ten years of age, were taught the method of self-pollution by
  their older playmates, and had made serious encroachments on the fund of
  constitutional vitality even before any considerable degree of sexual
  appetite was developed.</p>

<h3>FORCE OF HABIT.</h3>

  <p>Here, again, the fault was not in the power of passion, but in the
  force of habit. Parents and guardians of youth can not be too mindful of
  the character and habits of those with whom they allow young persons and
  children under their charge to associate intimately, and especially
  careful should they be with whom they allow them to sleep.</p>

<h3>SIN OF IGNORANCE.</h3>

  <p>It is customary to designate self-pollution as among the "vices." I
  think misfortune is the more appropriate term. It is true, that in the
  physiological sense, it is one of the very worst "transgressions of the
  law." But in the moral sense it is generally the sin of ignorance in the
  commencement, and in the end the passive submission to a morbid and
  almost resistless impulse.</p>

<h3>QUACKS.</h3>

  <p>The time has come when the rising generation must be thoroughly
  instructed in this matter. That quack specific "ignorance" has been
  experimented with quite too long already. The true method of insuring all
  persons, young or old, against the abuses of any part, organ, function,
  or faculty of the wondrous machinery of life, is to teach them its use.
  "Train a child in the way it should go" or be sure it <!-- Page 454
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page454"></a>[454]</span>will, amid the
  ten thousand surrounding temptations, find out a way in which it should
  not go. Keeping a child in ignorant innocence is, I aver, no part of the
  "training" which has been taught by a wiser than Solomon. Boys and girls
  do know, will know, and must know, that between them are important
  anatomical differences and interesting physiological relations. Teach
  them, I repeat, their use, or expect their abuse. Hardly a young person
  in the world would ever become addicted to self-pollution if he or she
  understood clearly the consequences; if he or she knew at the outset that
  the practice was directly destroying the bodily stamina, vitiating the
  moral tone, and enfeebling the intellect. No one would pursue the
  disgusting habit if he or she was fully aware that it was blasting all
  prospects of health and happiness in the approaching period of manhood
  and womanhood.</p>

<h3>GENERAL SYMPTOMS OF THE SECRET HABIT.</h3>

  <p>The effects of either self-pollution or excessive sexual indulgence,
  appear in many forms. It would seem as if God had written an instinctive
  law of remonstrance, in the innate moral sense, against this filthy
  vice.</p>

  <p>All who give themselves up to the excesses of this debasing
  indulgence, carry about with them, continually, a consciousness of their
  defilement, and cherish a secret suspicion that others look upon them as
  debased beings. They feel none of that manly confidence and gallant
  spirit, and chaste delight in the presence of virtuous females, which
  stimulate young men to pursue the course of ennobling refinement, and
  mature them for the social relations and enjoyments of life.</p>

  <p>This shamefacedness, or unhappy quailing of the countenance, on
  meeting the look of others, often follows them through life, in some
  instances even after they have entirely abandoned the habit, and became
  married men and respectable members of society.</p>

  <p>In some cases, the only complaint the patient will make on consulting
  you, is that he is suffering under a kind of continued fever. He will
  probably present a hot, dry skin, with something of a hectic appearance.
  Though all the ordinary means of arresting such symptoms have been tried,
  he is none the better.</p>

  <p>The sleep seems to be irregular and unrefreshing&mdash;restlessness
  during the early part of the night, and in the advanced stages of the
  disease, profuse sweats before morning. There is also frequent starting
  in the sleep, from <!-- Page 455 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page455"></a>[455]</span>disturbing dreams. The characteristic
  feature is, that your patient almost always dreams of sexual intercourse.
  This is one of the earliest, as well as most constant symptoms. When it
  occurs most frequently, it is apt to be accompanied with pain. A gleety
  discharge from the urethra may also be frequently discovered, especially
  if the patient examine when at stool or after urinating. Other common
  symptoms are nervous headache, giddiness, ringing in the ears, and a dull
  pain in the back part of the head. It is frequently the case that the
  patient suffers a stiffness in the neck, darting pains in the forehead,
  and also weak eyes are among the common symptoms.</p>

  <p>One very frequent, and perhaps early symptom (especially in young
  females) is solitariness&mdash;a disposition to seclude themselves from
  society. Although they may be tolerably cheerful when in company, they
  prefer rather to be alone.</p>

  <p>The countenance has often a gloomy and worn-down expression. The
  patient's friends frequently notice a great change. Large livid spots
  under the eyes is a common feature. Sudden flashes of heat may be noticed
  passing over the patient's face. He is liable also to palpitations. The
  pulse is very variable, generally too slow. Extreme emaciation, without
  any other assignable cause for it, may be set down as another very common
  symptom.</p>

  <p>If the evil has gone on for several years, there will be a general
  unhealthy appearance, of a character so marked as to enable an
  experienced observer at once to detect the cause. In the case of onanists
  especially there is a peculiar rank odor emitted from the body, by which
  they may be readily distinguished. One striking peculiarity of all these
  patients is, that they cannot look a man in the face! Cowardice is
  constitutional with them.</p>

<hr class="full" >

<h3>HOME TREATMENT OF THE SECRET HABIT.</h3>

  <p>1. The first condition of recovery is a prompt and permanent
  abandonment of the ruinous habit. Without a faithful adherence to this
  prohibitory law on the part of the patient all medication on the part of
  the physician will assuredly fail. The patient must plainly understand
  that future prospects, character, health, and life itself, depend on an
  unfaltering resistance to the morbid solicitation; with the assurance,
  however, that a due perseverance will eventually render what now seems
  like a resistless and overwhelming <!-- Page 456 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page456"></a>[456]</span>propensity, not only
  controllable but perfectly loathsome and undesirable.</p>

  <p>2. Keep the mind employed by interesting the patient in the various
  topics of the day, and social features of the community.</p>

  <p>3. Plenty of bodily out of door exercise, hoeing in the garden,
  walking, or working on the farm; of course not too heavy work must be
  indulged in.</p>

  <p>4. If the patient is weak and very much emaciated, cod liver oil is an
  excellent remedy.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Diet.</b> The patient should live principally on brown bread,
  oat meal, graham crackers, wheat meal, cracked or boiled wheat, or
  hominy, and food of that character. No meats should be indulged in
  whatever; milk diet if used by the patient is an excellent remedy. Plenty
  of fruit should be indulged in; dried toast and baked apples make an
  excellent supper. The patient should eat early in the evening, never late
  at night.</p>

  <p>6. Avoid all tea, coffee, or alcoholic stimulants of any kind.</p>

  <p>7. "Early to bed and early to rise," should be the motto of every
  victim of this vice. A patient should take a cold bath every morning
  after rising. A cold water injection in moderate quantities before
  retiring has cured many patients.</p>

  <p>8. If the above remedies are not sufficient, a family physician should
  be consulted.</p>

  <p>9. Never let children sleep together, if possible, to avoid it.
  Discourage the children of neighbors and friends from sleeping with your
  children.</p>

  <p>10. Have your children rise early. It is the lying in bed in the
  morning that plays the mischief.</p>

<h3>NOCTURNAL EMISSIONS</h3>

  <p>Involuntary emissions of semen during amorous dreams at night is not
  at all uncommon among healthy men. When this occurs from one to three or
  four times a month, no anxiety or concern need be felt.</p>

  <p>When the emissions take place without dreams, manifested only by
  stained spots in the morning on the linen, or take place at stool and are
  entirely beyond control, then the patient should at once seek for
  remedies or consult a competent physician. When blood stains are
  produced, then medical aid must be sought at once.</p>

<h3>HOME TREATMENT FOR NOCTURNAL EMISSIONS.</h3>

  <p>Sleep in a hard bed, and rise early and take a sponge bath in cold
  water every morning. Eat light suppers and refrain from eating late in
  the evening. Empty the bladder thoroughly before retiring, bathe the
  spine and hips with a sponge dipped in cold water.</p>

  <p><i>Never sleep lying on the back.</i></p>

  <p>Avoid all highly seasoned food and read good books, and keep the mind
  well employed. Take regular and vigorous outdoor exercise every day.</p>

  <p><b>Prescription.</b>&mdash;Ask your druggist to put you up a good Iron
  Tonic and take it regularly according to his directions.</p>

<h3>BEWARE OF ADVERTISING QUACKS.</h3>

  <p>Beware of these advertising schemes that advertise a speedy cure for
  "Loss of Youth," "Lost Vitality," "A Cure for Impotency," "Renewing of
  Old Age," etc. Do not allow these circulating pamphlets and circulars to
  concern you the least. If you have a few <i>Nocturnal Emissions</i>,
  remember it is only a mark of vitality and health, and not a sign of a
  deathly disease, as many of these advertising quacks would lead you to
  believe.</p>

  <p>Use your private organs only for what your Creator intended they
  should be used, and there will be no occasion for you to be frightened by
  the deception of quacks.</p>

<h2>Lost Manhood Restored.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>Resolute Desistence.</b>&mdash;The first step towards the
  restoration of lost manhood is a resolute desistence from these terrible
  sins. Each time the temptation is overcome, the power to resist becomes
  stronger, and the fierce fire declines. Each time the sin is committed,
  its hateful power strengthens, and the fire of lust is increased.
  Remember, that you cannot commit these sins, and maintain health and
  strength.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Avoid Being Alone.</b>&mdash;Avoid being alone when the
  temptation comes upon you to commit self-abuse. Change your thoughts at
  once; "keep the heart diligently, for out of it are the issues of
  life."</p>

  <p>3. <b>Avoid Evil Companions.</b>&mdash;Avoid evil companions, lewd
  conversation, bad pictures, corrupt and vicious novels, books, and
  papers. Abstain from all intoxicating drinks. These inflame the blood,
  excite the passions, and stimulate sensuality; weakening the power of the
  brain, they always impair the power of self-restraint. Smoking is very
  undesirable. Keep away from the moral pesthouses. Remember that these
  houses are the great resort of fallen and depraved men and women. The
  music, singing, and dancing are simply a blind to cover the intemperance
  and lust, which hold high carnival in these guilded hells. This, be it
  remembered, is equally true of the great majority of the theatres.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Avoid Strong Tea, or Coffee.</b>&mdash;Take freely of cocoa,
  milk, and bread and milk, or oatmeal porridge. Meats, such as beef and
  mutton, use moderately. We would strongly recommend to young men of full
  habit, vegetarian diet. Fruits in their season, partake liberally; also
  fresh vegetables. Brown bread and toast, as also rice, and similar
  puddings, are always suitable. Avoid rich pastry and new bread.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Three Meals a Day Are Abundant.</b>&mdash;Avoid suppers, and be
  careful, if troubled with nightly emissions, not to take any liquid, not
  even water, after seven o'clock in the evening, at latest. This will
  diminish the secretions of the body, when asleep, and the consequent
  emissions, which in the early hours or the morning usually follow the
  taking of any kind of drink. Do not be anxious or troubled by an
  occasional emission, say, for example, once a fortnight.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Rest on a Hard Mattress.</b>&mdash;Keep the body cool when
  asleep; heat arising from a load of bed-clothes is most <!-- Page 460
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page460"></a>[460]</span>undesirable.
  Turn down the counterpane, and let the air have free course through the
  blankets.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Relieve the System.</b>&mdash;As much as possible relieve the
  system of urine before going to sleep. On rising, bathe if practicable.
  If you cannot bear cold water, take the least possible chill off the
  water (cold water, however, is best). If bathing is not practicable, wash
  the body with cold water, and keep scrupulously clean. The reaction
  caused by cold water, is most desirable. Rub the body dry with a rough
  towel. Drink a good draught of cold water.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;Get fifteen minutes' brisk walk, if possible
  before breakfast. If any sense of faintness exists, eat a crust of bread,
  or biscuit. Be regular in your meals, and do not fear to make a hearty
  breakfast. This lays a good foundation for the day. Take daily good, but
  not violent exercise. Walk until you can distinctly feel the tendency to
  perspiration. This will keep the pores of the skin open and in healthy
  condition.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Medicines.</b>&mdash;Take the medicines, if used, regularly and
  carefully. Bromide of Potassium is a most valuable remedy in allaying
  lustful and heated passions and appetites. Unless there is actual
  venereal disease, medicine should be very little resorted to.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Avoid the Streets at Night.</b>&mdash;Beware of corrupt
  companions. Fast young men and women should be shunned everywhere.
  Cultivate a taste for good reading and evening studies. Home life with
  its gentle restraints, pure friendships, and healthful discipline, should
  be highly valued. There is no liberty like that of a well-regulated home.
  To large numbers of young men in business houses, home life is
  impracticable.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Be of Good Cheer and Courage.</b>&mdash;Recovery will be
  gradual, and not sudden; vital force is developed slowly from within. The
  object aimed at by medicine and counsel is to aid and increase nervous
  and physical vigor, and give tone to the demoralized system. Do not pay
  the slightest heed to the exaggerated statements of the wretched quack
  doctors, who advertise everywhere. Avoid them as you would a pestilence.
  Their great object is, through exciting your fears, to get you into their
  clutches, in order to oppress you with heavy and unjust payments. Be
  careful, not to indulge in fancies, or morbid thoughts and feelings. Be
  hopeful, and play the part of a man determined to overcome.</p>

<hr class="full" >

<p><!-- Page 461 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page461"></a>[461]</span></p>

<h2>Manhood Wrecked and Rescued.</h2>

  <p>1. <b>The Noblest Functions of Manhood.</b>&mdash;The noblest
  functions of manhood are brought into action in the office of the parent.
  It is here that man assumes the prerogative of a God and becomes a
  creator. How essential that every function of his physical system should
  be perfect, and every faculty of his mind free from that which would
  degrade; yet how many drag their purity through the filth of
  masturbation, revel in the orgies of the debauchee, and worship at the
  shrine of the prostitute, until, like a tree blighted by the livid
  lightning, they stand with all their outward form of men, but without
  life.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Threshold of Honor.</b>&mdash;Think of a man like that; in whom
  the passions and vices have burned themselves out, putting on the airs of
  a saint and claiming to have reformed! Aye, reformed, when there is no
  longer sweetness in the indulgence of lust. Think of such loathsome
  bestiality, dragging its slimy body across the threshold of honor and
  nobility and asking a pure woman, with the love-light of heaven in her
  eyes, to pass her days with him; to accept him as her lord; to be
  satisfied with the burnt-out, shriveled forces of manhood left; to
  sacrifice her purity that he may be redeemed, and to respect in a husband
  what she would despise in the brute.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Stop.</b>&mdash;If you are, then, on the highway to this state
  of degradation, stop. If already you have sounded the depths of lost
  manhood, then turn, and from the fountain of life regain your power,
  before you perpetrate the terrible crime of marriage, thus wrecking a
  woman's life and perhaps bringing into the world children who will live
  only to suffer and curse the day on which they were born and the father
  who begat them.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Sexual Impotency.</b>&mdash;Sexual impotency means sexual
  starvation, and drives many wives to ruin, while a similar lack among
  wives drives husbands to libertinism. Nothing so enhances the happiness
  of married couples as this full, life-abounding, sexual vigor in the
  husband, thoroughly reciprocated by the wife, yet completely controlled
  by both.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Two Classes of Sufferers.</b>&mdash;There are two classes of
  sufferers. First, those who have only practiced self-abuse and are
  suffering from emissions. Second, those who by overindulgence in marital
  relations, or by dissipation with women, have ruined their forces.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Remedy.</b>&mdash;For self-abuse: When the young man has
  practiced self-abuse for some time, he finds, upon <!-- Page 462 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page462"></a>[462]</span>quitting the habit,
  that he has nightly emissions. He becomes alarmed, reads every
  sensational advertisement in the papers, and at once comes to the
  conclusion that he must take something. <i>Drugs are not
  necessary.</i></p>

  <p>7. <b>Stop the Cause.</b>&mdash;The one thing needful, above all
  others, is to stop the cause. I have found that young men are invariably
  mistaken as to what is the cause. When asked as to the first cause of
  their trouble, they invariably say it was self-abuse, etc., but it is
  not. <i>It is the thought.</i> This precedes the handling, and, like
  every other cause, must be removed in order to have right results.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Stop the Thought.</b>&mdash;But remember, <i>stop the
  thought</i>! You must not look after every woman with lustful thoughts,
  nor go courting girls who will allow you to hug, caress and kiss them,
  thus rousing your passions almost to a climax. Do not keep the company of
  those whose only conversation is of a lewd and depraved character, but
  keep the company of those ladies who awaken your higher sentiments and
  nobler impulses, who appeal to the intellect and rouse your aspiration,
  in whose presence you would no more feel your passions aroused than in
  the presence of your own mother.</p>

  <p>9. <b>You Will Get Well.</b>&mdash;Remember you will get well. Don't
  fear. Fear destroys strength and therefore increases the trouble. Many
  get downhearted, discouraged, despairing&mdash;the very worst thing that
  can happen, doing as much harm, and in many cases more, than their former
  dissipation. Brooding kills; hope enlivens. Then sing with joy that the
  savior of knowledge has vanquished the death-dealing ignorance of the
  past; that the glorious strength of manhood has awakened and cast from
  you forever the grinning skeleton of vice. Be your better self, proud
  that your thoughts in the day-time are as pure as you could wish your
  dreams to be at night.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Helps.</b>&mdash;Do not use tobacco or liquor. They inflame the
  passions and irritate the nervous system; they only gratify base
  appetites and never rouse the higher feelings. Highly spiced food should
  be eschewed, not chewed. Meat should be eaten sparingly, and never at the
  last meal.</p>

  <p>11. <b>Don't Eat too Much.</b>&mdash;If not engaged in hard physical
  labor, try eating two meals a day. Never neglect the calls of nature, and
  if possible have a passage from the bowels every night before retiring.
  When this is not done the feces often drop into the rectum during sleep,
  producing heat which extends to the sexual organs, causing the lascivious
  dreams and emission. This will be noticed especially in the morning, when
  the feces usually distend <!-- Page 463 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page463"></a>[463]</span>the rectum and the person nearly always
  awakes with sexual passions aroused. If necessary, use injections into
  the rectum of from one to two quarts of water, blood heat, two or three
  times a week. Be sure to keep clean and see to it that no matter collects
  under the foreskin. Wash off the organ every night and take a quick, cold
  hand-bath every morning. Have something to do. Never be idle. Idleness
  always worships at the shrine of passion.</p>

  <p>12. <b>The Worst Time of All.</b>&mdash;Many are ruined by allowing
  their thoughts to run riot in the morning. Owing to the passions being
  roused as stated above, the young man lies half awake and half dozing,
  rousing his passions and reveling in lascivious thought for hours
  perhaps, thus completely sapping the fountains of purity, establishing
  habits of vice that will bind him with iron bands, and doing his physical
  system more injury than if he had practiced self-abuse, and had the
  emission in a few minutes. Jump out of bed at once on waking, and never
  allow the thought to master you.</p>

  <p>13. <b>A Hand Bath.</b>&mdash;A hand bath in cold water every morning
  will diminish those rampant sexual cravings, that crazy, burning, lustful
  desire so sensualizing to men by millions; lessen prostitution by toning
  down that passion which alone patronizes it, and relieve wives by the
  millions of those excessive conjugal demands which ruin their sexual
  health; besides souring their tempers, and then demanding millions of
  money for resultant doctor bills.</p>

  <p>14. <b>Will Get Well.</b>&mdash;Feel no more concern about your self.
  Say to yourself, "I shall and will get well under this treatment," as you
  certainly will. Pluck is half the battle. Mind acts and reads directly on
  the sexual organs. Determining to get well gets you well; whilst all fear
  that you will become worse makes you worse. All worrying over your case
  as if it were hopeless, all moody and despondent feelings, tear the life
  right out of these organs whilst hopefulness puts new life into them.</p>

<h2>The Curse and Consequence of Secret
Diseases.</h2>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs465.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/465.jpg"
      alt="Innocent Childhood." title="Innocent Childhood." /></a>
    INNOCENT CHILDHOOD.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>The Sins of the Fathers Are Visited on the
  Children.</b>&mdash;If persons who contract secret diseases were the only
  sufferers, there would be less pity and less concern manifested by the
  public and medical profession.</p>

  <p>2. There are many secret diseases which leave an hereditary taint, and
  innocent children and grandchildren are compelled to suffer as well as
  those who committed the immoral act.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Gonorrh&oelig;a</b> (Clap) is liable to leave the parts
  sensitive and irritable, and the miseries of spermatorrh&oelig;a,
  impotence, chronic rheumatism, stricture and other serious ailments may
  follow.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Syphilis</b> (Pox).&mdash;Statistics prove that over 30 per
  cent. of the children born alive perish within the first year. Outside of
  this frightful mortality, how many children are born, inheriting
  eruptions of the skin, foul ulcerations, <!-- Page 465 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page465"></a>[465]</span>swelling of the bones,
  weak eyes or blindness, scrofula, idiocy, stunted growth, and finally
  insanity, all on account of the father's early vices. The weaknesses and
  afflictions of parents are by natural laws visited upon their
  children.</p>

  <p>5. The mother often takes the disease from her husband, and she
  becomes an innocent sufferer to the dreaded disease. However, some other
  name generally is applied to the disease, and with perfect confidence in
  her husband she suffers pain all her life, ignorant of the true cause.
  Her children have diseases of the eyes, skin, glands and bones, and the
  doctor will apply the term scrofula, when the result is nothing more or
  less than inherited syphilis. Let every man remember, the vengeance to a
  vital law knows only justice, not mercy, and a single moment of illicit
  pleasure will bring many curses upon him, and drain out the life of his
  innocent children, and bring a double burden of disease and sorrow to his
  wife.</p>

  <p>6. If any man who has been once diseased is determined to marry, he
  should have his constitution tested thoroughly and see that every seed of
  the malady in the system has been destroyed. He should bathe daily in
  natural sulphur waters, as, for instance, the hot springs in Arkansas, or
  the sulphur springs in Florida, or those springs known as specific
  remedies for syphilic diseases. As long as the eruptions on the skin
  appear by bathing in sulphur water there is danger, and if the eruptions
  cease and do not appear, it is very fair evidence that the disease has
  left the system, yet it is not an infallible test.</p>

  <p>7. How many bright and intelligent young men have met their doom and
  blighted the innocent lives of others, all on account of the secret
  follies and vices of men.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Protection.</b>&mdash;Girls, you, who are too poor and too
  honest to disguise aught in your character, with your sweet soul shining
  through every act of your lives, beware of the men who smile upon you.
  Study human nature, and try and select a virtuous companion.</p>

  <p><i>Transcriber's note: there is no 9. in the original.</i></p>

  <p>10. <b>Syphilitic Poison Ineradicable.</b>&mdash;Many of our best and
  ablest physicians assert that syphilitic poison, once infected, there can
  be no total disinfection during life; some of the virus remains in the
  system, though it may seem latent. Boards of State Charities in
  discussing the causes of the existence of whole classes of defectives
  hold to the opinion given above. The Massachusetts board in its report
  has these strong words on the subject:</p>

  <p>"The worst is that, though years may have passed since its active
  stage, it permeates the very seed of life and <!-- Page 466 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page466"></a>[466]</span>causes strange
  affections or abnormalities in the offspring, or it tends to lessen their
  vital force, to disturb or to repress their growth, to lower their
  standard of mental and bodily vigor, and to render life puny and
  short.</p>

  <p>11. <b>A Serpent's Tooth.</b>&mdash;"<i>The direct blood-poisoning,
  caused by the absorption into the system of the virus (syphilis) is more
  hideous and terrible in its effect than that of a serpent's tooth.</i>
  This may kill outright, and there's an end; but that, stingless and
  painless, slowly and surely permeates and vitiates the whole system of
  which it becomes part and parcel, like myriads of trichinæ, and can never
  be utterly cast out, even by salivation.</p>

  <p>"Woe to the family and to the people in whose veins the poison
  courses!</p>

  <p>"It would seem that nothing could end the curse except utter
  extermination. That, however, would imply a purpose of eternal vengeance,
  involving the innocent with the guilty."</p>

  <p>This disease compared with small-pox is as an ulcer upon a finger to
  an ulcer in the vitals. Small-pox does not vitiate the blood of a people;
  this disease does. Its existence in a primary form implies moral
  turpitude.</p>

  <p>12. <b>Cases Cited.</b>&mdash;Many cases might be cited. We give but
  one. A man who had contracted the disease reformed his ways and was
  apparently cured. He married, and although living a moral life was
  compelled to witness in his little girl's eye-balls, her gums, and her
  breath the result of his past sins. No suffering, no expense, no effort
  would have been too great could he but be assured that his offspring
  might be freed from these results.</p>

  <p>13. <b>Prevention Better than Cure.</b>&mdash;Here is a case where the
  old adage, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," may be
  aptly applied. Our desire would be to herald to all young men in
  stentorian tones the advice, "Avoid as a deadly enemy any approaches or
  probable pitfalls of the disease. Let prevention be your motto and then
  you need not look for a cure."</p>

  <p>14. <b>Help Proffered.</b>&mdash;Realizing the sad fact that many are
  afflicted with this disease we would put forth our utmost powers to help
  even these, and hence give on the following pages some of the best
  methods of cure.</p>

<h3>HOW TO CURE GONORRH&OElig;A (Clap).</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><b>Causes, Impure Connections, etc.</b></p>

  <p><b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;As the disease first commences to manifest
  itself, the patient notices a slight itching at the point of the the <!--
  Page 467 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page467"></a>[467]</span>male
  organ, which is shortly followed by a tingling or smarting sensation,
  especially on making water. This is on account of the inflammation, which
  now gradually extends backward, until the whole canal is involved. The
  orifice of the urethra is now noticed to be swollen and reddened, and on
  inspection a slight discharge will be found to be present. And if the
  penis is pressed between the finger and thumb, matter or pus exudes. As
  the inflammatory stage commences, the formation of pus is increased,
  which changes from a thin to a thick yellow color, accompanied by a
  severe scalding on making water. The inflammation increases up to the
  fifth day, often causing such pain, on urinating, that the patient is
  tortured severely. When the disease reaches its height, the erections
  become somewhat painful, when the discharge may be streaked with
  blood.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><b>Home Treatment.</b></p>

  <p>First, see that the bowels are loose&mdash;if not, a cathartic should
  be given. If the digestive powers are impaired, they should be corrected
  and the general health looked after. If the system is in a good
  condition, give internally five drops of gelseminum every two hours. The
  first thing to be thought of is to pluck the disease in its bud, which is
  best done by injections. The best of these are: tinct. hydrastis, one
  drachm; pure water, four ounces; to be used three times a day after
  urinating. Zinc, sulphate, ten grains; pure water, eight ounces; to be
  used after urinating every morning and night. Equal parts of red wine and
  pure water are often used, and are of high repute, as also one grain of
  permanganate of potash to four ounces of water.</p>

  <p>If the above remedies are ineffectual, a competent physician should be
  consulted.</p>

  <p>General Treatment.&mdash;One of the best injections for a speedy cure
  is:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Hydrastis, 1 oz.</p>
      <p>Water, 5 oz.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Mix and with a small syringe inject into the penis four or five times
  a day after urinating, until relieved, and diminish the number of
  injections as the disease disappears. No medicine per mouth need be
  given, unless the patient is in poor health.</p>

<h3>SYPHILIS (Pox).</h3>

  <p>1. This is the worst of all diseases except cancer&mdash;no tissue of
  the body escapes the ravages of this dreadful <!-- Page 468 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page468"></a>[468]</span>disease&mdash;bone,
  muscle, teeth, skin and every part of the body are destroyed by its
  deforming and corroding influence.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;About eight days after the exposure a little
  redness and then a pimple, which soon becomes an open sore, makes its
  appearance, on or about the end of the penis in males or on the external
  or inner parts of the uterus of females. Pimples and sores soon multiply,
  and after a time little hard lumps appear in the groin, which soon
  develop into a blue tumor called <i>bubo</i>. Copper colored spots may
  appear in the face, hair fall out, etc. Canker and ulcerations in the
  mouth and various parts of the body soon develop.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;Secure the very best physician your means
  will allow without delay.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Local Treatment of Buboes.</b>&mdash;To prevent suppuration,
  treatment must be instituted as soon as they appear. Compresses, wet in a
  solution composed of half an ounce of muriate of ammonia, three drachms
  of the fluid extract of belladonna, and a pint of water, are beneficial,
  and should be continuously applied. The tumor may be scattered by
  painting it once a day with tincture of iodine.</p>

  <p>5. <b>For Eruptions.</b>&mdash;The treatment of these should be mainly
  constitutional. Perfect cleanliness should be observed, and the sulphur,
  spirit vapor, or alkaline bath freely used. Good diet and the persistent
  use of alteratives will generally prove successful in removing this
  complication.</p>

  <p><b>Recipe for Syphilis.</b>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Bin-iodide of mercury, 1 gr.</p>
      <p>Extract of licorice, 32 gr.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Make into 16 pills. Take one morning and night.</p>

  <p><i>LOTION.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Bichloride of mercury, 15 gr.</p>
      <p>Lime water, 1 pt.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Shake well, and wash affected parts night and morning.</p>

  <p><b>For Eruptions on Tongue.</b>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Cyanide of silver, ½ gr.</p>
      <p>Powdered iridis, 2 gr.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Divide into 10 parts. To be rubbed on tongue once a day.</p>

  <p><b>For Eruptions in Syphilis.</b>&mdash;A 5 per cent. ointment of
  carbolic acid in a good preparation.</p>

<h3>BUBO.</h3>

  <p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Warm poultice of linseed meal,</p>
      <p>Mercurial plaster,</p>
      <p>Lead ointment.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<h3>GLEET (Chronic Clap).</h3>

  <p>1. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;When gonorrh&oelig;a is not cured at the end
  of twenty-one or twenty-eight days, at which time all <!-- Page 469
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page469"></a>[469]</span>discharge
  should have ceased, we have a condition known as chronic clap, which is
  nothing more or less than gleet. At this time most of the symptoms have
  abated, and the principal one needing medical attention is the discharge,
  which is generally thin, and often only noticed in the morning on
  arising, when a scab will be noticed, glutinating the lips of the
  external orifice. Or, on pressing with the thumb and finger from behind,
  forward, a thin, white discharge can be noticed.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Home Treatment.</b>&mdash;The diet of patients affected with
  this disease is all-important, and should have careful attention. The
  things that should be avoided are highly spiced and stimulating foods and
  drinks, as all forms of alcohol, or those containing acids. Indulgence in
  impure thoughts is often sufficient to keep a discharge, on account of
  the excitement it produces to the sensitive organs, thus inducing
  erections, which always do harm.</p>

  <p>3. <b>General Treatment.</b>&mdash;The best injection is:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Nitrate of silver, ¼ grain.</p>
      <p>Pure water, 1 oz.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Inject three or four times a day after urinating.</p>

<h3>STRICTURE OF THE <span class="correction" title="text reads `URETHA'">URETHRA</span>.</h3>

  <p><b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;The patient experiences difficulty in voiding
  the urine, several ineffectual efforts being made before it will flow.
  The stream is diminished in size, of a flattened or spiral form, or
  divided in two or more parts, and does not flow with the usual force.</p>

  <p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;It is purely a surgical case and a competent
  surgeon must be consulted.</p>

<h3>PHIMOSIS.</h3>

  <p>1. <b>Cause.</b>&mdash;Is a morbid condition of the penis, in which
  the glans penis cannot be uncovered, either on account of a congenital
  smallness of the orifice of the foreskin, or it may be due to the acute
  stage of gonorrh&oelig;a, or caused by the presence of soft chancre.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;It is hardly necessary to give a description
  of the symptoms occurring in this condition, for it will be easily
  diagnosed, and its appearances are so indicative that all that is
  necessary is to study into its cause and treat the disease with reference
  to that.</p>

  <p><b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;If caused from acute gonorrh&oelig;a, it
  should be treated first by hot fomentations, to subdue the swelling, when
  the glans penis can be uncovered. If the result of the formation of
  chancre under the skin, they should be treated by a surgeon, for it may
  result in the sloughing off of the end of the penis, unless properly
  treated.</p>

<h2>Animal Magnetism.</h2>

<h3>WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO USE IT.</h3>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs471.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/471.jpg"
      alt="Magnetic Influences." title="Magnetic Influences." /></a>
    ILLUSTRATING MAGNETIC INFLUENCES.

    <p class="poem">ANIMAL MAGNETISM IS SUPPOSED TO RADIATE FROM AND
    ENCIRCLE EVERY HUMAN BEING.</p>
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Magnetism Existing Between the Bodies of Mankind.</b>&mdash;It
  is rational to believe that there is a magnetism existing between the
  bodies of mankind, which may have either a beneficial or a damaging
  effect upon our health, according to the conditions which are produced,
  or the nature of the individuals who are brought in contact with each
  other. As an illustration of this point we might consider that, all
  nature is governed by the laws of attraction and repulsion, or in other
  words, by positive and negative forces. These subtle forces or laws in
  nature which we call attraction or <!-- Page 471 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page471"></a>[471]</span>repulsion, are governed
  by the affinity&mdash;or sameness&mdash;or the lack of affinity&mdash;or
  sameness&mdash;which exists between what may be termed the combination of
  atoms or molecules which goes to make up organic structure.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Law of Attraction.</b>&mdash;Where this affinity&mdash;or
  sameness&mdash;exists between the different things, there is what we term
  the law of attraction, or what may be termed the disposition to unite
  together. Where there is no affinity existing between the nature of the
  different particles of matter, there is what may be termed the law of
  repulsion, which has a tendency to destroy the harmony which would
  otherwise take place.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Magnetism of the Mind.</b>&mdash;Now, what is true of the magnet
  and steel, is also true&mdash;from the sameness of their nature&mdash;of
  two bodies. And what is true of the body in this sense, is also true of
  the sameness or magnetism of the mind. Hence, <i>by the laying on of
  hands</i>, or by the association of the minds of individuals, we reach
  the same result as when a combination is produced in any department of
  nature. Where this sameness of affinity exists, there will be a blending
  of forces, which has a tendency to build up vitality.</p>

  <p>4. <b>A Proof.</b>&mdash;As a proof of this position, how often have
  you found the society of strangers to be so repulsive to your feelings,
  that you have no disposition to associate. Others seem to bring with them
  a soothing influence that draws you closer to them. All these involuntary
  likes and dislikes are but the results of the <i>animal magnetism</i>
  that we are constantly throwing off from our bodies,&mdash;although
  seemingly imperceptible to our internal senses.&mdash;The dog can scent
  his master, and determine the course which he pursues, no doubt from
  similar influences.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Home Harmony.</b>&mdash;Many of the infirmities that afflict
  humanity are largely due to a want of an understanding of its principles,
  and the right applications of the same. I believe that if this law of
  magnetism was more fully understood and acted upon, there would be a far
  greater harmony in the domestic circle; the health of parents and
  children might often be preserved where now sickness and discord so
  frequently prevail.</p>

  <p>6. <b>The Law of Magnetism.</b>&mdash;When two bodies are brought into
  contact with each other, the weak must naturally draw from the strong
  until both have become equal. And as long as this equality exists there
  will be perfect harmony between individuals, because of the reciprocation
  which exists in their nature. <!-- Page 472 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page472"></a>[472]</span></p>

  <p>7. <b>Survival of the Fittest.</b>&mdash;But if one should gain the
  advantage of the other in magnetic attraction, the chances are that
  through the law of development, or what has been termed the "Survival of
  the Fittest"&mdash;the stronger will rob the weaker until one becomes
  robust and <span class="correction" title="text reads `heatlhy'"
  >healthy</span>, while the other grows weaker and weaker day by day. This
  frequently occurs with children sleeping together, also between husband
  and wife.</p>

  <p>8. <b>Sleeping With Invalids.</b>&mdash;Healthy, hearty, vigorous
  persons sleeping with a diseased person is always at a disadvantage. The
  consumptive patient will draw from the strong, until the consumptive
  person becomes the strong patient and the strong person will become the
  consumptive. There are many cases on record to prove this statement. A
  well person should never sleep with an invalid if he desires to keep his
  health unimpaired, for the weak will take from the strong, until the
  strong becomes the weak and the weak the strong. Many a husband has died
  from a lingering disease which saved his wife from an early grave. He
  took the disease from his wife because he was the stronger, and she
  became better and he perished.</p>

  <p>9. <b>Husband and Wife.</b>&mdash;It is not always wise that husband
  and wife should sleep together, nor that children&mdash;whose temperament
  does not harmonize&mdash;should be compelled to sleep in the same bed. By
  the same law it is wrong for the young to sleep with old persons. Some
  have slept in the same bed with persons, when in the morning they have
  gotten up seemingly more tired than when they went to bed. At other times
  with different persons, they have lain awake two-thirds of the night in
  pleasant conversation and have gotten up in the morning without scarcely
  realizing that they had been to sleep at all, yet have felt perfectly
  rested and refreshed.</p>

  <p>10. <b>Magnetic Healing, or What Has Been Known as the Laying On of
  Hands.</b>&mdash;A nervous prostration is a negative condition beneath
  the natural, by the laying on of hands a person in a good, healthy
  condition is capable of communicating to the necessity of the weak. For
  the negative condition of the patient will as naturally draw from the
  strong, as the loadstone draws from the magnet, until both become equally
  charged. And as fevers are a positive condition of the system "beyond the
  natural," the normal condition of the healer will, by the laying on of
  the hands, absorb these positive atoms, until the fever of the patient
  becomes reduced or cured. As a proof of this the magnetic healer often
  finds himself or herself prostrated after treating the weak; and excited
  or feverish after treating a feverish patient.</p>

<h2>How to Read Character.</h2>

<h3>HOW TO TELL DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER
BY THE NOSE.</h3>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/gs474.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/474.jpg"
      alt="Well Mated." title="Well Mated." /></a>
    WELL MATED.
  </div>
  <p>1. <b>Large Noses.</b>&mdash;Bonaparte chose large-nosed men for his
  generals, and the opinion prevails that large noses indicate long heads
  and strong minds. Not that great noses cause great minds, but that the
  motive or powerful temperament cause both.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Flat Noses.</b>&mdash;Flat noses indicate flatness of mind and
  character, by indicating a poor, low organic structure.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Broad Noses.</b>&mdash;Broad noses indicate large passageways to
  the lungs, and this, large lungs and vital organs, and this, great
  strength of constitution, and hearty animal <!-- Page 474 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page474"></a>[474]</span>passions along with
  selfishness; for broad noses, broad shoulders, broad heads, and large
  animal organs go together. But when the nose is narrow at the base, the
  nostrils are small, because the lungs are small and need but small
  avenues for air; and this indicates a predisposition to consumptive
  complaints, along with an active brain and nervous system, and a
  passionate fondness for literary pursuits.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Sharp Noses.</b>&mdash;Sharp noses indicate a quick, clear,
  penetrating, searching, knowing, sagacious mind, and also a scold;
  indicate warmth of love, hate, generosity, moral sentiment&mdash;indeed,
  positiveness in everything.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Blunt Noses.</b>&mdash;Blunt noses indicate and accompany obtuse
  intellects and perceptions, sluggish feelings, and a soulless
  character.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Roman Noses.</b>&mdash;The Roman nose indicates a martial
  spirit, love of debate, resistance, and strong passions, while hollow,
  pug noses indicate a tame, easy, inert, sly character, and straight,
  finely-formed Grecian noses harmonious characters. Seek their
  acquaintance.</p>

<h3>DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY STATURE.</h3>

  <p>1. <b>Tall Persons.</b>&mdash;Tall persons have high heads, and are
  aspiring, aim high, and seek conspicuousness, while short ones have flat
  heads, and seek the lower forms of worldly pleasures. Tall persons are
  rarely mean, though often grasping; but very penurious persons are often
  broad-built.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Small Persons.</b>&mdash;Small persons generally have exquisite
  mentalities, yet less power&mdash;the more precious the article, the
  smaller the package in which it is done up,&mdash;while great men are
  rarely dwarfs, though great size often co-exists with sluggishness.</p>

<h3>DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE WALK.</h3>

  <p>1. <b>Awkward.</b>&mdash;Those whose motions are awkward yet easy,
  possess much efficiency and positiveness of character, yet lack polish;
  and just in proportion as they become refined in mind will their
  movements be correspondingly improved. A short and quick step indicates a
  brisk and active but rather contracted mind, whereas those who take long
  steps generally have long heads; yet if the step is slow, they will make
  comparatively little progress, while those whose step is long and quick
  will accomplish proportionately much, and pass most of their competitors
  on the highway of life. <!-- Page 475 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page475"></a>[475]</span></p>

  <p>2. <b>A Dragging Step.</b>&mdash;Those who sluff or drag their heels,
  drag and drawl in everything; while those who walk with a springing,
  bouncing step, abound in mental snap and spring. Those whose walk is
  mincing, affected, and artificial, rarely, if ever, accomplish much;
  whereas those who walk carelessly, that is, naturally, are just what they
  appear to be, and put on nothing for outside show.</p>

  <p>3. <b>The Different Modes of Walking.</b>&mdash;In short, every
  individual has his own peculiar mode of moving, which exactly accords
  with his mental character; so that, as far as you can see such modes, you
  can decipher such outlines of character.</p>

<h3>THE DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY LAUGHING.</h3>

  <p>1. <b>Laughter Expressive of Character.</b>&mdash;Laughter is very
  expressive of character. Those who laugh very heartily have much
  cordiality and whole-souledness of character, except that those who laugh
  heartily at trifles have much feeling, yet little sense. Those whose
  giggles are rapid but light, have much intensity of feeling, yet lack
  power; whereas those who combine rapidity with force in laughing, combine
  them in character.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Vulgar Laugh.</b>&mdash;Vulgar persons always laugh vulgarly,
  and refined persons show refinement in their laugh. Those who ha, ha
  right out, unreservedly, have no cunning, and are open-hearted in
  everything; while those who suppress laughter, and try to control their
  countenances in it, are more or less secretive. Those who laugh with
  their mouths closed are non-committal; while those who throw it wide open
  are unguarded and unequivocal in character.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Suppressed Laughter.</b>&mdash;Those who, suppressing laughter
  for a while, burst forth volcano-like, have strong characteristics, but
  are well-governed, yet violent when they give way to their feelings. Then
  there is the intellectual laugh, the love laugh, the horse laugh, the
  philoprogenitive laugh, the friendly laugh, and many other kinds of
  laugh, each indicative of corresponding mental developments.</p>

<h3>DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE MODE OF
SHAKING HANDS.</h3>

  <p><b>Their Expression of Character.</b>&mdash;Thus, those who give a
  tame and loose hand, and shake lightly, have a cold, if not heartless and
  selfish disposition, rarely sacrificing much for others, are probably
  conservatives, and lack warmth and <!-- Page 476 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page476"></a>[476]</span>soul. But those who
  grasp firmly, and shake heartily, have a corresponding whole-souledness
  of character, are hospitable, and will sacrifice business to friends;
  while those who bow low when they shake hands, add deference to
  friendship, and are easily led, for good or bad, by friends.</p>

    AN EASY-GOING DISPOSITION.
  </div>
<h3>THE DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE MOUTH
AND EYES.</h3>

  <p>1. <b>Different Forms of Mouths.</b>&mdash;Every mouth differs from
  every other, and indicates a coincident character. Large mouths express a
  corresponding quantity of mentality, while small ones indicate a lesser
  amount. A coarsely-formed mouth indicates power, while one finely-formed
  indicates exquisite susceptibilities. Hence small, delicately formed
  mouths indicate only common minds, with very fine feelings and much
  perfection of character.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Characteristics.</b>&mdash;Whenever the muscles about the mouth
  are distinct, the character is correspondingly positive, and the reverse.
  Those who open their mouths wide and frequently, thereby evince an open
  soul, while closed <!-- Page 477 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page477"></a>[477]</span>mouths, unless to hide deformed teeth, are
  proportionately secretive.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Eyes.</b>&mdash;Those who keep their eyes half shut are
  peek-a-boos and eaves-droppers.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Expressions of the Eye.</b>&mdash;The mere expression of the eye
  conveys precise ideas of the existing and predominant states of the
  mentality and physiology. As long as the constitution remains unimpaired,
  the eye is clear and bright, but becomes languid and soulless in
  proportion as the brain has been enfeebled. Wild, erratic persons have a
  half-crazed expression of eye, while calmness, benignancy, intelligence,
  purity, sweetness, love, lasciviousness, anger, and all the other mental
  affections, express themselves quite as distinctly by the eye as voice,
  or any other mode.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Color of the Eyes.</b>&mdash;Some inherit fineness from one
  parent, and coarseness from the other, while the color of the eye
  generally corresponds with that of the skin, and expresses character.
  Light eyes indicate warmth of feeling, and dark eyes power.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Garments.</b>&mdash;Those, who keep their coats buttoned up,
  fancy high-necked and closed dresses, etc., are equally
  non-communicative, but those who like open, free, flowing garments, are
  equally open-hearted and communicative.</p>

<h3>THE DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE COLOR
OF THE HAIR.</h3>

  <p>1. <b>Different Colors.</b>&mdash;Coarseness and fineness of texture
  in nature indicate coarse and fine-grained feelings and characters, and
  since black signifies power, and red ardor, therefore coarse black hair
  and skin signify great power of character of some kind, along with
  considerable tendency to the sensual; yet fine black hair and skin
  indicate strength of character, along with purity and goodness.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Coarse Hair.</b>&mdash;Coarse black hair and skin, and coarse
  red hair and whiskers, indicate powerful animal passions, together with
  corresponding strength of character; while fine or light, or auburn hair
  indicates quick susceptibilities, together with refinement and good
  taste.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Fine Hair.</b>&mdash;Fine dark or brown hair indicates the
  combination of exquisite susceptibilities with great strength of
  character, while auburn hair, with a florid countenance, indicates the
  highest order of sentiment and intensity of feeling, along with
  corresponding purity of character, combined with the highest capacities
  for enjoyment and suffering. <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page478"></a>[478]</span></p>

  <p>4. <b>Curly Hair.</b>&mdash;Curly hair or beard indicates a crisp,
  excitable, and variable disposition, and much diversity of
  character&mdash;now blowing hot, now cold&mdash;along with intense love
  and hate, gushing, glowing emotions, brilliancy, and variety of talent.
  So look out for ringlets; they betoken April weather&mdash;treat them
  gently, lovingly, and you will have the brightest, clearest sunshine, and
  the sweetest, balmiest breezes.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Straight Hair.</b>&mdash;Straight, even, smooth, and glossy hair
  indicate strength, harmony, and evenness of character, and hearty,
  whole-souled affections, as well as a clear head and superior talents;
  while straight, stiff, black hair and beard indicate a coarse, strong,
  rigid, straight-forward character.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Abundance of Hair.</b>&mdash;Abundance of hair and beard
  signifies virility and a great amount of character; while a thin beard
  signifies sterility and a thinly settled upper story, with rooms to let,
  so that the beard is very significant of character.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Fiery Red Hair</b> indicates a quick and fiery disposition.
  Persons with such hair generally have intense feelings&mdash;love and
  hate intensely&mdash;yet treat them kindly, and you have the warmest
  friends, but ruffle them, and you raise a hurricane on short notice. This
  is doubly true of auburn curls. It takes but little kindness, however, to
  produce a calm and render them as fair as a Summer morning. Red-headed
  people in general are not given to hold a grudge. They are generally of a
  very forgiving disposition.</p>

<h3>SECRETIVE DISPOSITIONS.</h3>

  <p>1. A man that naturally wears his hat upon the top or back of the head
  is frank and outspoken; will easily confide and have many confidential
  friends, and is less liable to keep a secret. He will never do you any
  harm.</p>

  <p>2. If a man wears his hat well down on the forehead, shading the eyes
  more or less, will always keep his own counsel. He will not confide a
  secret, and if criminally inclined will be a very dangerous
  character.</p>

  <p>3. If a lady naturally inclines to high-necked dresses and collars,
  she will keep her secrets to herself if she has any. In courtship or love
  she is an uncertainty, as she will not reveal sentiments of her heart.
  The secretive girl, however, usually makes a good housekeeper and rarely
  gets mixed into neighborhood difficulties. As a wife she will not be the
  most affectionate, nor will she trouble her husband with many of her
  trials or difficulties.</p>
